## üìù How to Create a New Plan

When creating a new plan document, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Create the Detailed Plan File

Create your plan in the `detailed/` subdirectory:

```bash
# Example
touch docs/plans/detailed/NEW_FEATURE_PLAN.md
```

### Step 2: Use the Plan Template

Every plan should include these sections:

```markdown
# [Feature/Project Name] - Plan

**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Version**: 1.0
**Status**: Active | Draft | Completed | Archived

---

## Executive Summary

Brief overview (2-3 paragraphs) of what this plan covers.

## Objectives

- Objective 1
- Objective 2
- Objective 3

## Current Status

What has been completed, what's pending, what's blocked.

## Detailed Plan

```

### Step 3: Add Entry to Master Index

Add a new section to this master index under "Current Active Plans":

```markdown

- **Purpose**: Brief description
- **Scope**: What it covers

**Current Progress**:
- ‚úÖ Completed item 1
- ‚ö†Ô∏è In progress item 2
- ‚ùå Not started item 3
- **Overall**: X% complete (Y/Z items)
```

### Step 4: Commit the Changes

```bash
git add docs/plans/MASTER_PLAN.md docs/plans/detailed/NEW_FEATURE_PLAN.md
git commit -m "docs: Add [Feature Name] plan"
```

---

## üîÑ How to Update a Plan

When updating an existing plan:

### Step 1: Update the Detailed Plan

Edit the plan file in `detailed/` subdirectory:

```bash
# Example
vim docs/plans/detailed/NBA_MCP_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md
```

Make your changes:
1. Update the **Version** number (increment patch for corrections, minor for new sections, major for complete rewrites)
2. Update the **Date** to today's date
3. Update the **Status** section with current progress
4. Add changes to relevant sections

### Step 2: Update This Master Index

Update the corresponding entry in this file:
1. Update **Last Verified** date
2. Update **Version** number
3. Update **Current Progress** metrics
4. Update **Status** if changed (Active ‚Üí Completed, etc.)

### Step 3: Commit the Changes

```bash
git add docs/plans/MASTER_PLAN.md docs/plans/detailed/[FILENAME].md
git commit -m "docs: Update [Plan Name] - [brief description of changes]"
```

## ‚úÖ How to Mark Tasks as Complete

When marking tasks as complete, **always verify first**:

### Verification Requirements

**DO NOT** mark a task as complete unless you have:

1. **Verified the implementation exists** - Check actual code files
2. **Verified it's registered/deployed** - Not just implemented but accessible
3. **Verified it works** - Run tests or manual verification
4. **Checked for edge cases** - Is it production-ready?

### Verification Process

```bash
# 1. Find the actual implementation
grep -r "function_name\|class_name" mcp_server/

# 2. Check if it's registered (for MCP tools)
grep "@mcp.tool()" mcp_server/fastmcp_server.py | grep -i "function_name"

# 3. Verify tests exist and pass
pytest tests/test_feature.py -v

# 4. Check documentation
grep -r "feature_name" docs/
```

### Update Process

1. **Update the detailed plan** - Mark checkboxes as `- [x]` and add verification notes
2. **Update this master index** - Update progress metrics
3. **Create verification report** - Document what was verified and how
4. **Commit all changes** together

Example commit:
```bash
git commit -m "docs: Mark [Feature] as complete with verification

- Verified implementation in [file:line]
- Confirmed registration in [file:line]
- Tests passing: [test files]
- Documentation updated: [doc files]"
```

## üîç Verification Best Practices

### For MCP Tools

```bash
# Count registered tools
grep -c "@mcp.tool()" mcp_server/fastmcp_server.py

# List all tool names
grep -B 1 "@mcp.tool()" mcp_server/fastmcp_server.py | grep "^async def " | sed 's/async def //' | sed 's/(.*$//'

# Verify specific tool
grep -A 10 "@mcp.tool()" mcp_server/fastmcp_server.py | grep -A 10 "async def tool_name"
```

### For Features

```bash
# Check if file exists
ls -la mcp_server/tools/feature_helper.py

# Check if feature is imported
grep "from mcp_server.tools.feature_helper import" mcp_server/

# Check test coverage
pytest tests/ -v | grep feature

# Check documentation
find docs/ -name "*.md" -exec grep -l "feature_name" {} \;
```

### For Dependencies

```bash
# Check if dependency is installed
pip show package-name

# Check if dependency is in requirements
grep "package-name" requirements.txt

# Check if dependency is imported
grep "import package_name\|from package_name" mcp_server/
```

## üìä Plan Status Definitions

- **Draft**: Plan is being written, not yet approved
- **Active**: Plan is approved and work is in progress
- **Completed**: All tasks from the plan are done and verified
- **Archived**: Plan is no longer relevant (superseded or cancelled)
- **On Hold**: Plan is paused, waiting for dependencies or decisions

---

## üóÑÔ∏è Archived Plans

Completed or superseded plans should be moved to `detailed/archive/`:

```bash
mv docs/plans/detailed/OLD_PLAN.md docs/plans/detailed/archive/
```

Update this master index to reflect the archival:

```markdown
### [Plan Name] (ARCHIVED)
- **File**: [`detailed/archive/FILENAME.md`](detailed/archive/FILENAME.md)
- **Status**: Archived
- **Archived Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
- **Reason**: Completed | Superseded by [other plan] | Cancelled
```

## ü§ù Contributing

When adding or updating plans:

1. **Always verify before marking complete** - No assumptions!
2. **Keep the master index updated** - It's the single source of truth
3. **Use semantic versioning** - Major.Minor.Patch
4. **Document verification steps** - How did you confirm it works?
5. **Link to evidence** - File names, line numbers, test results
6. **Update progress metrics** - Keep percentages accurate
7. **Commit changes together** - Master index + detailed plan + verification report

---

**Remember**: This master index exists to prevent confusion about what's been done. Always verify, never assume!
