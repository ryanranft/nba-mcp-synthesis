**What:** Every response has consistent format with request_id, timestamp, and error classification
**Tests:** 3 test cases
**Time:** 10 minutes

### Quick Win #2: Async Semaphore (Concurrency Control)
**What:** Limits concurrent tool executions to protect APIs and database
**Tests:** 3 test cases
**Time:** 10 minutes

### Quick Win #3: Pydantic Parameter Validation
**What:** Automatic validation prevents SQL injection and path traversal
**Tests:** 10 test cases
**Time:** 15 minutes

## Setup (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Set Environment Variables

```bash
# Add to ~/.zshrc (or ~/.bash_profile)
export RDS_HOST="your-rds-host.region.rds.amazonaws.com"
export RDS_DATABASE="nba_simulator"
export RDS_USERNAME="postgres"
export RDS_PASSWORD="your-password"
export S3_BUCKET="your-s3-bucket"
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your-key"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your-secret"
export MCP_TOOL_CONCURRENCY=5
export MCP_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG

# Apply changes
source ~/.zshrc
```

### Step 2: Install Claude Desktop Configuration

```bash
cd /Users/ryanranft/nba-mcp-synthesis
./setup_claude_desktop.sh
```

### Step 3: Restart Claude Desktop

1. Press `Cmd+Q` to quit
2. Reopen from Applications
3. Wait 10-15 seconds
4. Look for MCP tools icon (üîå)

---

## First Test (Verify It's Working)

**Copy-paste this into Claude Desktop:**

```
What MCP tools do you have available? List all tools from the nba-mcp-synthesis server.
```

**Expected:**
Claude should list 10+ tools including:
- query_database
- get_table_schema
- list_tables
- list_s3_files
- And more...

**If this works, you're ready to test!** ‚úÖ

**If this doesn't work:**
- Check logs: `tail -f ~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp*.log`
- See troubleshooting in testing guide

---

## What Happens Next?

### During Testing
You'll copy-paste test prompts into Claude Desktop and verify:
- ‚úÖ Valid queries work correctly
- ‚úÖ Invalid queries are rejected with detailed errors
- ‚úÖ All responses have consistent format
- ‚úÖ Concurrency limiting protects downstream services
- ‚úÖ Security validations prevent SQL injection

### After Testing
1. Complete the checklist
2. Report results (all pass or any failures)
3. If all pass: Move to Option 3 (Analyze more MCP repos)
4. If any fail: Troubleshoot and retest
