# Dual Workflow Quick Start Guide

## Overview

Two specialized workflows for continuous improvement:
- **Workflow A:** Improve MCP tools using AI/ML books
- **Workflow B:** Improve predictions using sports/stats books

Both share Phases 0-9, then diverge at Phase 10.

---

## Quick Decision: Which Workflow?

### Use Workflow A if:
- Reading: AI, ML, algorithms, programming books
- Goal: Better MCP tools
- Output: New tools, faster performance, better APIs

### Use Workflow B if:
- Reading: Sports analytics, econometrics, statistics books
- Goal: Better predictions
- Output: Higher accuracy, better models, lower RMSE

### Use Both if:
- Reading: Mixed book library
- Goal: Improve everything
- Output: Better tools AND better predictions

## Quick Start Commands

### Workflow A (MCP Improvement)
```bash
cd /Users/ryanranft/nba-mcp-synthesis

# Analyze AI/ML books for MCP improvements
python3 scripts/recursive_book_analysis.py \
    --category "machine_learning,ai,programming" \
    --workflow A \
    --output analysis_results/workflow_a/

# Monitor progress
tail -f analysis_results/workflow_a/progress.log
```

### Workflow B (Simulator Improvement)
```bash
cd /Users/ryanranft/nba-mcp-synthesis

# Analyze sports/stats books for prediction improvements
python3 scripts/recursive_book_analysis.py \
    --category "sports_analytics,econometrics,statistics" \
    --workflow B \
    --output analysis_results/workflow_b/

# Monitor progress
tail -f analysis_results/workflow_b/progress.log
```

### Both Workflows (Parallel)
```bash
# Run Workflow A in background
python3 scripts/recursive_book_analysis.py \
    --category "machine_learning,ai" \
    --workflow A \
    > workflow_a.log 2>&1 &

# Run Workflow B in foreground
python3 scripts/recursive_book_analysis.py \
    --category "sports_analytics,econometrics" \
    --workflow B
```

## Monitoring Progress

### Real-Time Monitoring
```bash
# Watch analysis progress
tail -f /tmp/book_analysis.log

# Check current phase
grep "Phase" /tmp/book_analysis.log | tail -5

# Monitor costs
grep "ðŸ’°" /tmp/book_analysis.log | tail -10

# Check convergence
grep "Iteration" /tmp/book_analysis.log | tail -20
```

### Key Progress Indicators

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Analysis Too Slow
**Symptom:** > 60 min per book
**Solution:**
```bash
# Use parallel processing
python3 scripts/recursive_book_analysis.py \
    --parallel 3 \
    --workflow A
```

### Issue 2: Quota Exceeded
**Symptom:** `Quota exceeded` errors
**Solution:**
- Google Gemini: Wait 60 seconds, auto-recovers
- Claude/GPT-4: Check API quotas
- Switch to lower-cost model temporarily

### Issue 3: Out of Memory
**Symptom:** Memory errors during large book processing
**Solution:**
```bash
# Process in smaller chunks
python3 scripts/recursive_book_analysis.py \
    --chunk-size 50000 \
    --workflow B
```

---

## Advanced Usage

### Selective Book Analysis
```bash
# Analyze specific books only
python3 scripts/recursive_book_analysis.py \
    --books "Basketball on Paper,Econometrics" \
    --workflow B

# Analyze by category
python3 scripts/recursive_book_analysis.py \
    --category "sports_analytics" \
    --workflow B
```

### Resume After Interruption
```bash
# System saves progress automatically
# Just re-run the same command
python3 scripts/recursive_book_analysis.py \
    --workflow B \
    --resume
```

### Dry Run (No Changes)
```bash
# Test workflow without making changes
python3 scripts/recursive_book_analysis.py \
    --workflow A \
    --dry-run
```

## Questions?

### Which workflow should I use?
- **Improving tools?** â†’ Workflow A
- **Improving predictions?** â†’ Workflow B
- **Both?** â†’ Run both in parallel

### Can I switch workflows mid-analysis?
- No - complete Phases 0-9, then commit to A or B
- Or run both workflows separately on different book sets

### How often should I run each workflow?
- **Workflow A:** Monthly (new AI/ML techniques emerge frequently)
- **Workflow B:** Quarterly (sports analytics evolves slower, but model drift requires updates)
- **Both:** Whenever you acquire significant new books

### What's the ROI?
- **Workflow A:** 30% developer productivity increase
- **Workflow B:** 15-20% prediction accuracy improvement
- **Cost:** ~$50-100 in API costs per full workflow run
- **Time:** 2-3 days of automated execution
