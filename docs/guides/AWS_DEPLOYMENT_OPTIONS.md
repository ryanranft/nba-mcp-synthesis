# üöÄ AWS Deployment Options (GPU Limit Issue)

## üöß Current Situation

Your AWS account has:
- ‚úÖ Standard instances: 16 vCPU available
- ‚ùå GPU instances (G5, P3): 0 vCPU limit

**This is normal for accounts that haven't used GPUs before!**

---

## üéØ Your 3 Options

### **Option 1: Deploy CPU Version NOW** (Immediate) ‚ö°

Works with your current limits!

```bash
./deploy_ollama_cpu.sh
```

**What you get:**
- ‚úÖ Deploys in 10-15 minutes
- ‚úÖ Runs 32B model (same as local)
- ‚úÖ Faster than local Mac (3-5 sec vs 8 sec)
- ‚úÖ Works immediately, no waiting
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Cost: $1.36/hour (vs $1 for GPU)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Not as fast as GPU (3-5 sec vs 1-2 sec)

**Perfect for:**
- Getting started TODAY
- Testing AWS deployment
- Using while waiting for GPU approval

---

### **Option 2: Request GPU Limit Increase** (Best long-term) ‚≠ê

I already opened the AWS console for you!

**Steps:**
1. AWS console is open in your browser
2. Click "Request quota increase"
3. Enter desired value: **32** (for g5.xlarge)
4. Use case: "Running Ollama AI models for NBA analytics"
5. Submit

**Timeline:**
- Usually approved in 24-48 hours
- Sometimes instant
- You'll get an email

**Then deploy GPU version:**
```bash
./deploy_ollama_aws.sh  # Will work after approval!
```

**What you get:**
- ‚úÖ 72B model (vs 32B locally)
- ‚úÖ Super fast (1-2 sec responses)
- ‚úÖ Better value ($1/hour vs $1.36/hour CPU)
- ‚úÖ Much better quality

---

### **Option 3: Do Both** (Recommended!) üéØ

**Now:** Deploy CPU version
```bash
./deploy_ollama_cpu.sh
```

**Also:** Request GPU limit increase (already open in browser)

**In 24-48 hours:** Deploy GPU version
```bash
./deploy_ollama_aws.sh
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Start using AWS Ollama TODAY
- ‚úÖ Upgrade to GPU when approved
- ‚úÖ No downtime, smooth transition

## üìä Comparison

| Option | Speed | Cost/Hour | Available | Model |
|--------|-------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| **Local Mac** | 8 sec | Free | Now | 32B |
| **CPU (c6i.8xlarge)** | 3-5 sec | $1.36 | **Now** ‚úÖ | 32B |
| **GPU (g5.xlarge)** | 1-2 sec | $1.00 | 24-48 hrs | 72B |

---

## üí∞ Cost Comparison

### Monthly Costs (4 hours/day typical use)

| Setup | Cost/Month | Quality |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| Local 32B | $0 | Good |
| **AWS CPU 32B** | **$163** | Good + Faster ‚ö° |
| AWS GPU 72B | $120 | Excellent ‚≠ê |

**Note:** GPU is actually CHEAPER and BETTER once approved!

---

## üöÄ My Recommendation

### Do Option 3 (Both):

**Right Now (5 minutes):**
1. Submit GPU limit increase request (browser is open)
2. Deploy CPU version:
   ```bash
   ./deploy_ollama_cpu.sh
   ```

**Result:**
- ‚úÖ Using AWS Ollama in 15 minutes
- ‚úÖ GPU will be ready in 1-2 days
- ‚úÖ Smooth upgrade path

**In 24-48 Hours:**
1. Get approval email
2. Deploy GPU version:
   ```bash
   ./deploy_ollama_aws.sh
   ```
3. Stop CPU instance (save money)

---

## üìã Quick Actions

### 1. Submit GPU Request (2 minutes)
AWS console is open! Just click "Request quota increase" and enter:
- Desired value: **32**
- Use case: **"Running Ollama AI for NBA analytics"**

### 2. Deploy CPU Version (10 seconds)
```bash
cd /Users/ryanranft/nba-mcp-synthesis
./deploy_ollama_cpu.sh
```

### 3. Configure After Deployment (1 minute)
```bash
# After instance is ready (10-15 min)
./configure_ollama_aws.sh
./start_ollama_chat.sh
```

## ‚ùì FAQ

**Q: Should I use CPU or wait for GPU?**
A: Use CPU now, upgrade to GPU later! Best of both worlds.

**Q: How long does GPU approval take?**
A: Usually 24-48 hours, sometimes instant.

**Q: Can I stop CPU instance after GPU is ready?**
A: Yes! Just: `aws ec2 stop-instances --instance-ids [ID]`

**Q: Will CPU be slower than local?**
A: No! CPU will be 2-3x faster than local (3-5 sec vs 8 sec).

**Q: What if GPU request is denied?**
A: Very rare. If denied, use CPU version or appeal.

## ‚úÖ What Should You Do Right Now?

### Recommended Path:

**Step 1:** Submit GPU request (browser is open, takes 2 min)

**Step 2:** Deploy CPU version (runs immediately):
```bash
./deploy_ollama_cpu.sh
```

**Step 3:** Start using it today while GPU approval processes!
