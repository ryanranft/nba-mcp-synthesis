## üìà Analysis Methodology

### Analysis Process
1. **Code Review**: Systematic code review and analysis
2. **Pattern Identification**: Identify common patterns and anti-patterns
3. **Integration Assessment**: Evaluate external integrations
4. **Documentation**: Document findings and recommendations

### Analysis Tools
- Static code analysis
- Dependency analysis
- Integration testing
- Performance profiling

---

## üéØ Context Optimization

**Purpose**: Analysis files provide focused technical insights without loading full codebase context

**Navigation Strategy**:
- Use specific analysis files for targeted technical questions
- Reference analysis summaries for high-level insights
- Avoid loading multiple analysis files simultaneously

**Token Usage**:
- This index: ~25 tokens
- Individual analysis file: 400-800 tokens
- Total for analysis review: 425-825 tokens

---

## üìä Analysis Archive Strategy

### Active Analysis
- Current technical analysis
- Recent integration assessments

### Archived Analysis
- Historical analysis (moved to archive after 30 days)
- Superseded analysis (replaced by newer analysis)

### Archive Timeline
- Analysis files archived 30 days after completion
- Summary files kept for 90 days
- Key findings kept permanently
