## Overview

This document summarizes the successful implementation and testing of **Phase 5.3: Formula Dependency Graph** within the NBA MCP Server. This phase introduces a comprehensive system for analyzing relationships between sports analytics formulas, visualizing their dependencies, and understanding their complexity and interconnectedness.

## Key Achievements

### 1. Core Formula Dependency Graph Module (`mcp_server/tools/formula_dependency_graph.py`)

## Error Handling and Fixes

### Issue 1: NetworkX Degree Calculation
**Problem**: `G.in_degree()` and `G.out_degree()` returned `InDegreeView` and `OutDegreeView` objects that couldn't be directly summed or cast to integers.

**Solution**: Used `len(list(G.predecessors(node_id)))` and `len(list(G.successors(node_id)))` to get integer degree values.

### Issue 2: Node Existence Validation
**Problem**: Attempting to analyze nodes that didn't exist in the NetworkX graph.

**Solution**: Added validation to ensure only nodes that exist in the NetworkX graph are included in analysis operations.
