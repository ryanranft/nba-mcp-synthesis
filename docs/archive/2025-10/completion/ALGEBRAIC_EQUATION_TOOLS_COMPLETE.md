- No LaTeX rendering
- Limited to basic arithmetic

### ✅ **Algebraic Tools Advantages:**

1. **🎯 Preserve Exact Formulas**: Symbolic manipulation maintains precision
2. **🔍 Enable Advanced Operations**: Calculus, matrix operations, system solving
3. **📝 Render Beautiful Notation**: LaTeX output for professional display
4. **🏀 Include Sports Templates**: Pre-built analytics formulas
5. **📚 Integrate with Books**: Works seamlessly with PDF reading tools
6. **🧮 Support Complex Analysis**: Multi-variable systems and advanced math

## 📖 **Perfect for Sports Analytics Books**

### **Workflow Example:**

1. **Read Formula from Book**: Use PDF tools to extract mathematical formulas
2. **Parse with Algebra Tools**: Convert formulas to symbolic expressions
3. **Manipulate Symbolically**: Simplify, differentiate, integrate as needed
4. **Substitute Values**: Use actual player/team statistics
5. **Calculate Results**: Get numerical answers
6. **Render LaTeX**: Display beautiful mathematical notation

### **Real Examples:**

```python
# Solve quadratic equation from book
await mcp.call_tool("algebra_solve_equation", {
    "equation": "x**2 + 2*x - 3 = 0"
})
# Result: Solutions: [-3.0, 1.0], LaTeX: x^{2} + 2 x - 3 = 0

# Calculate True Shooting Percentage
await mcp.call_tool("algebra_sports_formula", {
    "formula_name": "true_shooting",
    "variables": {"PTS": 25, "FGA": 15, "FTA": 5}
})
# Result: 0.727 (72.7% TS%)

# Find derivative of efficiency function
await mcp.call_tool("algebra_differentiate", {
    "expression": "x**3 + 2*x**2 + x",
    "variable": "x"
})
# Result: 3*x**2 + 4*x + 1, LaTeX: 3 x^{2} + 4 x + 1
```
