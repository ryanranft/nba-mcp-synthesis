## Progress by Day

### ‚úÖ Day 1: Caching Infrastructure (3-4 hours) - COMPLETE

**Implemented:**
- `scripts/result_cache.py` (172 lines)
- Content-based caching with SHA-256 hashes
- TTL-based expiration (7 days default)
- Size-limited storage (5 GB max)
- LRU eviction for old/unused entries
- Metadata tracking (hits, size, timestamps)

**Integration:**

**Plan:**
1. Update `run_full_workflow.py` with Tier 1 support
2. End-to-end test: analyze 10 books with caching + parallel + checkpoints
3. Measure performance improvements
4. Verify all acceptance criteria
5. Create `TIER_1_TESTING_REPORT.md`

**Acceptance Criteria to Verify:**
- ‚úÖ Caching system works for book analysis
- ‚úÖ Cache hit rate > 80% on repeated analysis
- ‚è≥ Checkpoints save every 5 minutes during Phase 3
- ‚è≥ Can resume Phase 3 from checkpoint after interruption
- ‚è≥ Parallel execution analyzes 4 books simultaneously
- ‚úÖ Configuration loaded from workflow_config.yaml
- ‚úÖ All config changes apply without code edits

**Performance Goals:**
- ‚úÖ Re-run cost reduced by 80-90% (cache hits) - Phase 2 now $0
- ‚è≥ Parallel execution reduces total time by 60-75%
- ‚è≥ Checkpoint overhead < 5% of total runtime
- ‚úÖ Cache storage < 5GB for 45 books (configured)

       executor.map(analyze_book, books)
   ```
