---

## 🚀 Implementation Process

### Step 1: Review Priority Action List

```bash
cd /Users/ryanranft/nba-mcp-synthesis
cat PRIORITY_ACTION_LIST.md
```

**Key Sections:**
- **Tier 1**: 23 recommendations with 0 dependencies → **Start here**
- **Tier 2**: Recommendations with 1-2 dependencies
- **Tier 3**: Recommendations with 3+ dependencies

### Step 2: Select First Recommendation

**Recommendation:** Start with `rec_001` (Continuous Integration for Data Validation)

**Location:**
```
/Users/ryanranft/nba-simulator-aws/docs/phases/phase_0/rec_001_implement_continuous_integration_for_data_validati/
```

### Step 3: Read Implementation Files

For each recommendation, read these files **in order**:

#### 3.1 README.md
- **Purpose**: Overview, architecture, quick start
- **What to look for**: High-level understanding of what you're building

```bash
cd /Users/ryanranft/nba-simulator-aws/docs/phases/phase_0/rec_001_implement_continuous_integration_for_data_validati/
cat README.md
```

#### 3.2 STATUS.md
- **Purpose**: Implementation checklist and metadata
- **What to look for**: Priority, risk, estimated effort, dependencies
- **Action**: Mark tasks as complete as you finish them

#### 3.3 RECOMMENDATIONS_FROM_BOOKS.md
- **Purpose**: Source attribution (which books recommended this)
- **What to look for**: Context on why this recommendation matters

#### 3.4 IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md
- **Purpose**: Step-by-step instructions
- **What to look for**: Detailed implementation steps, prerequisites, validation criteria
- **Action**: Follow these steps exactly

### Step 4: Implement the Recommendation

#### 4.1 Run Implementation Script

```bash
cd /Users/ryanranft/nba-simulator-aws/docs/phases/phase_0/rec_001_implement_continuous_integration_for_data_validati/
python3 implement_rec_001.py
```

**Note**: This script contains skeleton code. You may need to:
- Add missing imports
- Fill in TODO sections
- Connect to actual data sources
- Configure environment variables

#### 4.2 Run Tests

```bash
python3 -m pytest test_rec_001.py -v
```

**Expected**: All tests should pass. If they fail, debug until they pass.

#### 4.3 Update STATUS.md

```bash
# Mark as complete
echo "✅ Implementation complete: $(date)" >> STATUS.md
echo "✅ Tests passing: $(date)" >> STATUS.md
echo "✅ Deployed to: [environment]" >> STATUS.md
```

### Step 5: Verify Integration

#### 5.1 Check Integration Points
- Does this recommendation integrate with existing systems?
- Are there API endpoints that need updating?
- Do any other services need to be restarted?

#### 5.2 Run Integration Tests
```bash
cd /Users/ryanranft/nba-simulator-aws
python3 -m pytest tests/integration/ -k "rec_001" -v
```

### Step 6: Commit Changes

```bash
cd /Users/ryanranft/nba-simulator-aws
git add .
git commit -m "Implement rec_001: Continuous Integration for Data Validation

- Added CI pipeline for data validation
- Integrated with existing data pipeline
- All tests passing
- Deployed to staging

Source: Practical MLOps, Designing ML Systems
Status: COMPLETE ✅"
git push origin main
```

### Step 7: Move to Next Recommendation

**Check dependencies first:**

```bash
# Check PRIORITY_ACTION_LIST.md for next recommendation
cd /Users/ryanranft/nba-mcp-synthesis
grep -A 5 "rec_002" PRIORITY_ACTION_LIST.md
```

**If dependencies are met:** Proceed to Step 2 with next recommendation

**If dependencies are NOT met:** Skip to next available recommendation with met dependencies

## 📊 Tracking Progress

### Update Master Tracker

Create a file to track overall progress:

```bash
cd /Users/ryanranft/nba-mcp-synthesis
cat > IMPLEMENTATION_PROGRESS.md << 'EOF'
# Implementation Progress

**Last Updated**: $(date)

## Summary
- Total Recommendations: 218
- Completed: 0
- In Progress: 0
- Blocked: 0
- Remaining: 218

## Recent Completions
- [ ] rec_001 - Continuous Integration for Data Validation

## Next Up
- [ ] rec_007 - Establish robust monitoring for prompt and generation fidelity
- [ ] rec_018 - Set up automated data ingestion pipeline from NBA API

## Blocked (Waiting on Dependencies)
- None yet

## Notes
- Started implementation on $(date)
EOF
```

**Update this file after each completion.**

---

## ⚠️ Important Rules

### 1. **Always Follow Dependency Order**
- Never implement a recommendation before its prerequisites
- Check `DEPENDENCY_GRAPH.md` if unsure
- If blocked, skip to next available recommendation

### 2. **Always Run Tests**
- Every recommendation has a test file
- Tests must pass before marking complete
- If tests fail, debug until they pass

### 3. **Always Commit After Each Recommendation**
- Small, incremental commits are better than large ones
- Use descriptive commit messages
- Reference the recommendation ID in commit message

### 4. **Always Update STATUS.md**
- Mark completion timestamp
- Note any deviations from original plan
- Document any issues encountered

### 5. **Never Skip Validation**
- Follow `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` validation steps
- Run integration tests
- Verify deployment to staging/production

---

## 🎯 Implementation Strategy

### Option A: Sequential (Safest)
- Implement recommendations 1-by-1 in priority order
- Fully test each before moving to next
- **Time Estimate**: 3-4 weeks (8 hours/day)
- **Risk**: Low
- **Recommended for**: First-time implementations

### Option B: Parallel (Faster)
- Identify all Tier 1 recommendations (0 dependencies)
- Implement up to 5 in parallel
- Merge and test together before moving to Tier 2
- **Time Estimate**: 2-3 weeks (8 hours/day)
- **Risk**: Medium
- **Recommended for**: Experienced implementations with good test coverage

### Option C: Phase-by-Phase (Organized)
- Complete all recommendations in Phase 0 before moving to Phase 1
- Ensures each layer is solid before building next
- **Time Estimate**: 3-4 weeks (8 hours/day)
- **Risk**: Low-Medium
- **Recommended for**: Systematic, methodical approach

**My Recommendation**: **Option B (Parallel)** for fastest completion with acceptable risk.

## 💡 Tips for Success

### 1. **Start Small**
- Begin with easiest recommendations first (LOW risk, LOW effort)
- Build confidence before tackling CRITICAL/HIGH risk items

### 2. **Read Documentation Thoroughly**
- Don't skip `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`
- It contains critical context and gotchas

### 3. **Test Continuously**
- Run tests after each code change
- Don't wait until end to test

### 4. **Ask for Help When Stuck**
- Document blockers in `STATUS.md`
- Note specific error messages
- Flag for human review if blocked > 2 hours

### 5. **Celebrate Progress**
- Update `IMPLEMENTATION_PROGRESS.md` after each completion
- Track your velocity (recommendations per day)
- Adjust strategy if needed

---

## 📈 Expected Progress

### Week 1 (Target: 30-40 recommendations)
- All Tier 1 recommendations (23 recs)
- Easy Tier 2 recommendations (10-15 recs)

### Week 2 (Target: 70-90 recommendations total)
- Medium Tier 2 recommendations (30-40 recs)
- Start Tier 3 (10-20 recs)

### Week 3 (Target: 150-180 recommendations total)
- Complete Tier 2 (60-80 recs)
- Continue Tier 3 (30-40 recs)

### Week 4 (Target: 218 recommendations total)
- Complete all remaining recommendations (38-68 recs)
- Final integration testing
- Performance validation

---

## 🚨 Escalation Criteria

**Stop and escalate to human if:**

1. **Tests fail after 3 debugging attempts**
   - Document the error in `STATUS.md`
   - Flag with `⚠️ BLOCKED` status

2. **Implementation requires architecture changes**
   - Note in `STATUS.md`
   - Propose alternative in comments

3. **Dependencies are incorrect**
   - Document circular dependency or missing prerequisite
   - Update `DEPENDENCY_GRAPH.md` with correction

4. **Resource constraints hit**
   - Disk space < 10GB
   - Memory usage > 80%
   - API rate limits reached

5. **Security concerns**
   - Credentials needed
   - Sensitive data exposure
   - Authentication/authorization issues
