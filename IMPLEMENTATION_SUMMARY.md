## When to Use Each System

### Use High-Context When:

✅ Budget allows (~$30 for 45 books)
✅ Need comprehensive book coverage
✅ Advanced chapters contain critical information
✅ Want highest quality recommendations
✅ Full narrative arc important

### Use Standard When:

✅ Budget constrained (~$10 for 45 books)
✅ First 100 pages sufficient
✅ Need quick overview
✅ Prefer more model validation (4 vs 2)

---

## Quality Comparison

### Standard System (4 models, 25k tokens)
- Coverage: First ~100 pages
- Recommendations: 26-42 per book
- Consensus: 2+ of 4 models agree (70%)
- Strengths: Multi-model validation, lower cost
- Limitations: Misses advanced chapters, limited context

### High-Context System (2 models, 250k tokens)
- Coverage: **Full book** (cover to cover)
- Recommendations: 30-60 per book
- Consensus: Both models agree (80%)
