# Implement Limited Dependent Variable Models for Binary Outcomes

## Overview

Implement limited dependent variable models, such as probit or logit models, to analyze binary outcomes such as win/loss, player injury status, or successful shot attempts.  These models are appropriate when the dependent variable is binary and OLS regression is not suitable.

**Key Benefits:**
- Improves code organization and maintainability
- Enhances system capabilities
- Aligns with industry best practices

---

## Implementation Status

This is a **Tier 0 basic placeholder**. Full implementation requires:
1. Detailed code generation (Tier 1+)
2. Comprehensive test suite (Tier 1+)
3. Integration with nba-simulator-aws (Phase 9)
4. Validation and testing (Phase 8.5)

---

## Quick Start

```python
# Basic implementation placeholder
# Full code will be generated in Tier 1+

class ImplementLimitedDependentVariableModelsForBi:
    """
    Implement Limited Dependent Variable Models for Binary Outcomes.

    Based on: ECONOMETRICS A Modern Approach
    """

    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def setup(self):
        """Initialize system."""
        pass

    def execute(self):
        """Execute main workflow."""
        pass
```
