## Overview

When there are several objectives during training, balance the weighting to properly affect results. By weighting correctly, the model can be more accurately targeted to solve for specific use-cases.

**Key Benefits:**
- Improves code organization and maintainability
- Enhances system capabilities
- Aligns with industry best practices

## Implementation Status

This is a **Tier 0 basic placeholder**. Full implementation requires:
1. Detailed code generation (Tier 1+)
2. Comprehensive test suite (Tier 1+)
3. Integration with nba-simulator-aws (Phase 9)
4. Validation and testing (Phase 8.5)

## Quick Start

```python
# Basic implementation placeholder
# Full code will be generated in Tier 1+

class TrainModelWithTwoObjectives:
    """
    Train Model With Two Objectives.

    Based on: Hands On Generative AI with Transformers and Diffusion
    """

    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def setup(self):
        """Initialize system."""
        pass

    def execute(self):
        """Execute main workflow."""
        pass
```
