## Overview

Use Elastic Net regression, which combines L1 (LASSO) and L2 (Ridge) regularization, for simultaneous feature selection and regularization. This is particularly useful when dealing with high-dimensional data with correlated features.

**Key Benefits:**
- Improves code organization and maintainability
- Enhances system capabilities
- Aligns with industry best practices

---

## Implementation Status

This is a **Tier 0 basic placeholder**. Full implementation requires:
1. Detailed code generation (Tier 1+)
2. Comprehensive test suite (Tier 1+)
3. Integration with nba-simulator-aws (Phase 9)
4. Validation and testing (Phase 8.5)

---

## Quick Start

```python
# Basic implementation placeholder
# Full code will be generated in Tier 1+

class ImplementElasticNetRegressionForSimultaneous:
    """
    Implement Elastic Net Regression for Simultaneous Feature Selection and Regularization.

    Based on: Hastie, Tibshirani, Friedman   "Elements of Statistical Learning"
    """

    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def setup(self):
        """Initialize system."""
        pass

    def execute(self):
        """Execute main workflow."""
        pass
```
