Implement Bayesian Network for Player Performance Prediction

Source: Artificial Intelligence   A Modern Approach (3rd Edition)
Category: ML

This is a Tier 0 basic placeholder.
Full implementation will be generated in Tier 1+ with AI assistance.

Description:
Utilize Bayesian Networks to model the probabilistic relationships between various player statistics (e.g., points, assists, rebounds, minutes played) and predict future performance. This allows for more nuanced and context-aware predictions than simple regression models.
