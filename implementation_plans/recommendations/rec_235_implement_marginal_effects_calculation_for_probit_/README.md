## Overview

Implement the calculation of marginal effects for Probit and Logit models. This provides a more interpretable measure of the effect of a variable on the probability of the outcome.

**Key Benefits:**
- Improves code organization and maintainability
- Enhances system capabilities
- Aligns with industry best practices

---

## Implementation Status

This is a **Tier 0 basic placeholder**. Full implementation requires:
1. Detailed code generation (Tier 1+)
2. Comprehensive test suite (Tier 1+)
3. Integration with nba-simulator-aws (Phase 9)
4. Validation and testing (Phase 8.5)

## Quick Start

```python
# Basic implementation placeholder
# Full code will be generated in Tier 1+

class ImplementMarginalEffectsCalculationForProbit:
    """
