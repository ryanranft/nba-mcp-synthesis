# Implement Multinomial Logit Models for Categorical Outcomes

## Overview

Implement multinomial logit models to analyze categorical outcomes with more than two categories, such as player positions (e.g., point guard, shooting guard, small forward, power forward, center) or different types of game outcomes (e.g., win, loss, draw). These models allow for the analysis of factors that influence the probability of belonging to each category.

**Key Benefits:**
- Improves code organization and maintainability
- Enhances system capabilities
- Aligns with industry best practices

## Implementation Status

This is a **Tier 0 basic placeholder**. Full implementation requires:
1. Detailed code generation (Tier 1+)
2. Comprehensive test suite (Tier 1+)
3. Integration with nba-simulator-aws (Phase 9)
4. Validation and testing (Phase 8.5)

---

## Quick Start

```python
# Basic implementation placeholder
# Full code will be generated in Tier 1+

class ImplementMultinomialLogitModelsForCategorical:
    """

    Based on: ECONOMETRICS A Modern Approach
    """

    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def setup(self):
        """Initialize system."""
        pass

    def execute(self):
        """Execute main workflow."""
        pass
```
