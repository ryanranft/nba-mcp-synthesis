Compare Models of Player Valuation with Cross-Validation Methods

Source: STATISTICS 601 Advanced Statistical Methods ( PDFDrive )
Category: Testing

This is a Tier 0 basic placeholder.
Full implementation will be generated in Tier 1+ with AI assistance.

Description:
For different parameters in the model, evaluate what features lead to certain outcomes. It could be shown with a test set of data what key variables were responsible for a higher or lower team performance.
