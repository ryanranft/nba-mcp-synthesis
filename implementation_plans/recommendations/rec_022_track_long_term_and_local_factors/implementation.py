"""
Track Long Term and Local Factors

Source: Designing Machine Learning Systems
Category: Monitoring

This is a Tier 0 basic placeholder.
Full implementation will be generated in Tier 1+ with AI assistance.

Description:
Track local factors by considering long range relationships, as the local features on their own have a harder time capturing. When combining data from each machine learning process, do so in tandem to measure effects together. Track both over time to capture all events.
