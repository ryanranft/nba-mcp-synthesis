## Overview

Implement instrumental variables (IV) regression to address potential endogeneity issues in the analysis of player or team performance.  This is especially useful when examining the causal effect of a variable that might be correlated with the error term in the regression model (e.g., the impact of a specific coaching strategy where the implementation of the strategy is correlated with unobserved team characteristics).

**Key Benefits:**
- Improves code organization and maintainability
- Enhances system capabilities
- Aligns with industry best practices

## Implementation Status

This is a **Tier 0 basic placeholder**. Full implementation requires:
1. Detailed code generation (Tier 1+)
2. Comprehensive test suite (Tier 1+)
3. Integration with nba-simulator-aws (Phase 9)
4. Validation and testing (Phase 8.5)

---

## Quick Start

```python
# Basic implementation placeholder
# Full code will be generated in Tier 1+

class ImplementInstrumentalVariablesRegressionForCa:
    """
    Implement Instrumental Variables Regression for Causal Inference.

    Based on: ECONOMETRICS A Modern Approach
    """

    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def setup(self):
        """Initialize system."""
        pass

    def execute(self):
        """Execute main workflow."""
        pass
```
