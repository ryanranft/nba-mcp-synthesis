## Overview

Integrate a Kalman Filter to smooth and predict player trajectories from real-time tracking data. This reduces noise and provides more accurate estimates of player positions and velocities, which can be used for tactical analysis and player movement pattern recognition.

**Key Benefits:**
- Improves code organization and maintainability
- Enhances system capabilities
- Aligns with industry best practices

## Implementation Status

This is a **Tier 0 basic placeholder**. Full implementation requires:
1. Detailed code generation (Tier 1+)
2. Comprehensive test suite (Tier 1+)
3. Integration with nba-simulator-aws (Phase 9)
4. Validation and testing (Phase 8.5)

## Quick Start

```python
# Basic implementation placeholder
# Full code will be generated in Tier 1+

class ImplementAKalmanFilterForRealTimePlayerTra:
    """
    Implement a Kalman Filter for Real-Time Player Tracking Data Smoothing and Prediction.

    Based on: Probabilistic Machine Learning Advanced Topics... (Z Library)
    """

    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def setup(self):
        """Initialize system."""
        pass

    def execute(self):
        """Execute main workflow."""
        pass
```
