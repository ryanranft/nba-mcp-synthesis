Incorporate Time Series Analysis for Player Performance Trend Forecasting

Source: Probabilistic Machine Learning Advanced Topics... (Z Library)
Category: Statistics

This is a Tier 0 basic placeholder.
Full implementation will be generated in Tier 1+ with AI assistance.

Description:
Use time series analysis techniques like ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, or Prophet to forecast player performance trends over time. This can help with player valuation, contract negotiations, and long-term roster planning. Analyze performance changes based on game schedule.
