Calculate Expected Value for Player Actions

Source: Mathematics for Computer Science Eric Lehman
Category: Statistics

This is a Tier 0 basic placeholder.
Full implementation will be generated in Tier 1+ with AI assistance.

Description:
Calculate the expected value of different player actions (e.g., shooting, passing, dribbling) based on their historical success rates and the potential outcome of each action. This will help players make more informed decisions during games.
