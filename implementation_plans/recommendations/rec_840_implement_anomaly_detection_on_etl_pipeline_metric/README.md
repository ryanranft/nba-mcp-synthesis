## Overview

Monitor key metrics of the ETL pipeline (e.g., data ingestion rate, data transformation time, error rate) and use anomaly detection techniques to identify potential issues or bottlenecks in the pipeline.  This allows for proactive identification of data processing problems.

**Key Benefits:**
- Improves code organization and maintainability
- Enhances system capabilities
- Aligns with industry best practices

## Implementation Status

This is a **Tier 0 basic placeholder**. Full implementation requires:
1. Detailed code generation (Tier 1+)
2. Comprehensive test suite (Tier 1+)
3. Integration with nba-simulator-aws (Phase 9)
4. Validation and testing (Phase 8.5)

---

## Quick Start

```python
# Basic implementation placeholder
# Full code will be generated in Tier 1+

class ImplementAnomalyDetectionOnEtlPipelineMetric:
    """
    Implement anomaly detection on ETL pipeline metrics.

    Based on: Bishop Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning 2006
    """

    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def setup(self):
        """Initialize system."""
        pass

    def execute(self):
        """Execute main workflow."""
        pass
```
