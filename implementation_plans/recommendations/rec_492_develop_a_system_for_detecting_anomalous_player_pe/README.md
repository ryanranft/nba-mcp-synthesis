## Overview

Implement a system that detects anomalous player performance, such as unusually high or low scores, compared to their historical averages. This can help identify players who are underperforming or exceeding expectations and flag potential injuries or other issues.

**Key Benefits:**
- Improves code organization and maintainability
- Enhances system capabilities
- Aligns with industry best practices

---

## Implementation Status

This is a **Tier 0 basic placeholder**. Full implementation requires:
1. Detailed code generation (Tier 1+)
2. Comprehensive test suite (Tier 1+)
3. Integration with nba-simulator-aws (Phase 9)
4. Validation and testing (Phase 8.5)

---

## Quick Start

```python
# Basic implementation placeholder
# Full code will be generated in Tier 1+

class DevelopASystemForDetectingAnomalousPlayerPe:
    """
    Develop a System for Detecting Anomalous Player Performance.

    Based on: ML Machine Learning A Probabilistic Perspective
    """

    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def setup(self):
        """Initialize system."""
        pass

    def execute(self):
        """Execute main workflow."""
        pass
```
