## Overview

Develop an A/B testing framework to rigorously evaluate the impact of new strategies (e.g., lineup changes, play calls) on team performance. This will allow the team to make data-driven decisions about which strategies to implement.

**Key Benefits:**
- Improves code organization and maintainability
- Enhances system capabilities
- Aligns with industry best practices

## Implementation Status

This is a **Tier 0 basic placeholder**. Full implementation requires:
1. Detailed code generation (Tier 1+)
2. Comprehensive test suite (Tier 1+)
3. Integration with nba-simulator-aws (Phase 9)
4. Validation and testing (Phase 8.5)

## Quick Start

```python
# Basic implementation placeholder
# Full code will be generated in Tier 1+

class ImplementAbTestingFrameworkForEvaluatingNew:
    """
    Implement A/B Testing Framework for Evaluating New Strategies.

    Based on: Anaconda Sponsored Manning Generative AI in Action
    """

    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def setup(self):
        """Initialize system."""
        pass

    def execute(self):
        """Execute main workflow."""
        pass
```
