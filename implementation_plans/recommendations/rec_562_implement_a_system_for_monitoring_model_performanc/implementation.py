Implement a System for Monitoring Model Performance and Detecting Concept Drift

Source: ECONOMETRICS A Modern Approach
Category: Monitoring

This is a Tier 0 basic placeholder.
Full implementation will be generated in Tier 1+ with AI assistance.

Description:
Implement a system to continuously monitor the performance of all statistical and machine learning models in production. This system should track key metrics such as prediction accuracy, error rates, and calibration. Additionally, it should detect concept drift, which occurs when the relationship between the input features and the target variable changes over time. Techniques such as comparing the distribution of predictions and inputs over time, or using drift detection algorithms, should be employed.
