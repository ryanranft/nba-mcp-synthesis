# Implement a Two-Pass Process to Improve Search Quality

**Status:** ‚è≥ PENDING IMPLEMENTATION
**Source Book:** Hands On Large Language Models
**Category:** Performance
**Created:** 2025-10-19T05:47:00.952084

## Overview

A way to incorporate language models is through two passes. First, the system will get a number of results. Then, the system will then reorder the results based on relevance to the search.

**Key Benefits:**
- Improves code organization and maintainability
- Enhances system capabilities
- Aligns with industry best practices

## Implementation Status

This is a **Tier 0 basic placeholder**. Full implementation requires:
1. Detailed code generation (Tier 1+)
2. Comprehensive test suite (Tier 1+)
3. Integration with nba-simulator-aws (Phase 9)
4. Validation and testing (Phase 8.5)

## Quick Start

```python
# Basic implementation placeholder
# Full code will be generated in Tier 1+

class ImplementATwoPassProcessToImproveSearchQua:
    """
    Implement a Two-Pass Process to Improve Search Quality.

    Based on: Hands On Large Language Models
    """

    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def setup(self):
        """Initialize system."""
        pass

    def execute(self):
        """Execute main workflow."""
        pass
```
