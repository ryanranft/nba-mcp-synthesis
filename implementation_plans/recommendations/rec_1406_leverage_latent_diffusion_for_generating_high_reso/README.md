## Overview

Apply latent diffusion techniques to generate high-resolution NBA action shots. This reduces the computational cost of generating high-resolution images by performing the diffusion process in the latent space and helps with video content generation.

**Key Benefits:**
- Improves code organization and maintainability
- Enhances system capabilities
- Aligns with industry best practices

## Implementation Status

This is a **Tier 0 basic placeholder**. Full implementation requires:
1. Detailed code generation (Tier 1+)
2. Comprehensive test suite (Tier 1+)
3. Integration with nba-simulator-aws (Phase 9)
4. Validation and testing (Phase 8.5)

## Quick Start

```python
# Basic implementation placeholder
# Full code will be generated in Tier 1+

class LeverageLatentDiffusionForGeneratingHighReso:
    """
    Leverage Latent Diffusion for Generating High-Resolution NBA Action Shots.

    Based on: Hands-On Generative AI with Transformers and Diffusion
    """

    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def setup(self):
        """Initialize system."""
        pass

    def execute(self):
        """Execute main workflow."""
        pass
```
