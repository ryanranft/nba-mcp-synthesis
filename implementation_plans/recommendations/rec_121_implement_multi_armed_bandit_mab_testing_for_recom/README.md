## Overview

Implement Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) testing to optimize the recommendation engine for NBA player predictions or betting recommendations. This will involve using MAB algorithms to dynamically allocate traffic to different recommendation strategies and learn which strategies perform best over time. Consider libraries like Vowpal Wabbit or Optuna.

**Key Benefits:**
- Improves code organization and maintainability
- Enhances system capabilities
- Aligns with industry best practices

## Implementation Status

This is a **Tier 0 basic placeholder**. Full implementation requires:
1. Detailed code generation (Tier 1+)
2. Comprehensive test suite (Tier 1+)
3. Integration with nba-simulator-aws (Phase 9)
4. Validation and testing (Phase 8.5)

## Quick Start

```python
# Basic implementation placeholder
# Full code will be generated in Tier 1+

class ImplementMultiArmedBanditMabTestingForRecom:
    """

    Based on: AI Engineering
    """

    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def setup(self):
        """Initialize system."""
        pass

    def execute(self):
        """Execute main workflow."""
        pass
```
