# Experiment with Dropout Regularization

**Status:** ‚è≥ PENDING IMPLEMENTATION
**Source Book:** Generative Deep Learning
**Category:** ML
**Created:** 2025-10-19T01:45:41.431029

---

## Overview

Add dropout layers to reduce overfitting, especially after dense layers. Experiment with different dropout rates (e.g., 0.25, 0.5).

**Key Benefits:**
- Improves code organization and maintainability
- Enhances system capabilities
- Aligns with industry best practices

---

## Implementation Status

This is a **Tier 0 basic placeholder**. Full implementation requires:
1. Detailed code generation (Tier 1+)
2. Comprehensive test suite (Tier 1+)
3. Integration with nba-simulator-aws (Phase 9)
4. Validation and testing (Phase 8.5)

---

## Quick Start

```python
# Basic implementation placeholder
# Full code will be generated in Tier 1+

class ExperimentWithDropoutRegularization:
    """
    Experiment with Dropout Regularization.

    Based on: Generative Deep Learning
    """

    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def setup(self):
        """Initialize system."""
        pass

    def execute(self):
        """Execute main workflow."""
        pass
```
