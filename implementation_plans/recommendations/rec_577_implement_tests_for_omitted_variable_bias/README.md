# Implement Tests for Omitted Variable Bias

## Overview

Implement tests to detect omitted variable bias in regression models. Omitted variable bias occurs when a relevant variable is not included in the model, and this variable is correlated with both the dependent variable and one or more of the included independent variables. This can lead to biased estimates of the coefficients. Use tests such as the omitted variable test or the Durbin-Wu-Hausman test to detect omitted variable bias.

**Key Benefits:**
- Improves code organization and maintainability
- Enhances system capabilities
- Aligns with industry best practices

## Implementation Status

This is a **Tier 0 basic placeholder**. Full implementation requires:
1. Detailed code generation (Tier 1+)
2. Comprehensive test suite (Tier 1+)
3. Integration with nba-simulator-aws (Phase 9)
4. Validation and testing (Phase 8.5)

---

## Quick Start

```python
# Basic implementation placeholder
# Full code will be generated in Tier 1+

class ImplementTestsForOmittedVariableBias:
    """
    Implement Tests for Omitted Variable Bias.

    Based on: ECONOMETRICS A Modern Approach
    """

    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def setup(self):
        """Initialize system."""
        pass

    def execute(self):
        """Execute main workflow."""
        pass
```
