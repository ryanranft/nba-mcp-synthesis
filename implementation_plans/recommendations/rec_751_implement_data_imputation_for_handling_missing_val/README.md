## Overview

Implement data imputation techniques to handle missing values in the dataset. Common imputation methods include replacing missing values with the mean, median, or mode of the feature, or using more advanced techniques such as k-nearest neighbors imputation or model-based imputation. Missing value imputation is critical if data is incomplete.

**Key Benefits:**
- Improves code organization and maintainability
- Enhances system capabilities
- Aligns with industry best practices

## Implementation Status

This is a **Tier 0 basic placeholder**. Full implementation requires:
1. Detailed code generation (Tier 1+)
2. Comprehensive test suite (Tier 1+)
3. Integration with nba-simulator-aws (Phase 9)
4. Validation and testing (Phase 8.5)

---

## Quick Start

```python
# Basic implementation placeholder
# Full code will be generated in Tier 1+

class ImplementDataImputationForHandlingMissingVal:
    """
    Implement Data Imputation for Handling Missing Values.

    Based on: Deep Learning by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, Aaron Courville
    """

    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def setup(self):
        """Initialize system."""
        pass

    def execute(self):
        """Execute main workflow."""
        pass
```
