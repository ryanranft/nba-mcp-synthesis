## Overview

Utilize wearable technology (accelerometers, heart rate monitors) to capture player physiological data. Develop anomaly detection algorithms to identify unusual or potentially dangerous patterns in this data, such as sudden drops in performance or signs of overexertion, potentially indicating an injury risk.

**Key Benefits:**
- Improves code organization and maintainability
- Enhances system capabilities
- Aligns with industry best practices

## Implementation Status

This is a **Tier 0 basic placeholder**. Full implementation requires:
1. Detailed code generation (Tier 1+)
2. Comprehensive test suite (Tier 1+)
3. Integration with nba-simulator-aws (Phase 9)
4. Validation and testing (Phase 8.5)

---

## Quick Start

```python
# Basic implementation placeholder
# Full code will be generated in Tier 1+

class ImplementAnomalyDetectionOnSensorDataFromWe:
    """
    Implement anomaly detection on sensor data from wearable technology..

    Based on: Hastie, Tibshirani, Friedman   "Elements of Statistical Learning"
    """

    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def setup(self):
        """Initialize system."""
        pass

    def execute(self):
        """Execute main workflow."""
        pass
```
