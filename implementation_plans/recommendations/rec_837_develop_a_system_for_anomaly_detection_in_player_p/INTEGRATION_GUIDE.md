## Prerequisites

Before integrating, ensure:
- [ ] Phase 8.5 validation passed
- [ ] All dependencies installed
- [ ] Test environment available
- [ ] Backup of nba-simulator-aws created

---

## Integration Steps (Tier 0 Basic)

### Step 1: Copy Files

```bash
# Copy implementation files to nba-simulator-aws
# (Exact paths to be determined by Smart Integrator in Tier 1+)

cp implementation.py /path/to/nba-simulator-aws/[target_directory]/
cp README.md /path/to/nba-simulator-aws/docs/
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
# If additional dependencies are needed
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Configuration

```python
# Add configuration to nba-simulator-aws config file
# (Specific configuration to be determined in Tier 1+)
```

### Step 4: Testing

```bash
# Run tests to verify integration
pytest tests/
```

## Expected Impact

**Benefits:**
- [Benefit 1 - to be defined in Tier 1+]
- [Benefit 2 - to be defined in Tier 1+]

**Risks:**
- Low (Tier 0 basic version has minimal impact)
- Full risk assessment in Tier 1+ with Smart Integrator

---

## Rollback Procedure

If integration fails:

```bash
# Restore from backup
python scripts/rollback_manager.py --restore [backup_id]
```

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Complete Phase 8.5 validation
2. ⏭️  Run Phase 9 integration (with --dry-run first)
3. ✅ Test in nba-simulator-aws environment
4. ✅ Monitor for issues

---

**Note:** This is a Tier 0 basic guide. Tier 1+ will include:
- Exact file placement from Smart Integrator
- Detailed dependency analysis
- Comprehensive test plan
- Conflict resolution strategies
