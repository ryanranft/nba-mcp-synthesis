## Overview

Implement a caching layer to store frequently accessed data in memory, reducing latency and improving the performance of the NBA analytics system. This can be achieved using caching technologies like Redis or Memcached.

**Key Benefits:**
- Improves code organization and maintainability
- Enhances system capabilities
- Aligns with industry best practices

## Implementation Status

This is a **Tier 0 basic placeholder**. Full implementation requires:
1. Detailed code generation (Tier 1+)
2. Comprehensive test suite (Tier 1+)
3. Integration with nba-simulator-aws (Phase 9)
4. Validation and testing (Phase 8.5)

## Quick Start

```python
# Basic implementation placeholder
# Full code will be generated in Tier 1+

class ImplementACachingLayerForFrequentlyAccessed:
    """
    Implement a Caching Layer for Frequently Accessed Data.

    Based on: Bishop Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning 2006
    """

    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def setup(self):
        """Initialize system."""
        pass

    def execute(self):
        """Execute main workflow."""
        pass
```
