# Implement Cross-Validation for Model Evaluation

**Status:** ‚è≥ PENDING IMPLEMENTATION
**Source Book:** Deep Learning by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, Aaron Courville
**Category:** Testing

## Overview

Implement k-fold cross-validation to obtain a more robust estimate of the model's performance. Split the data into k folds, train the model on k-1 folds, and evaluate it on the remaining fold. Repeat this process k times, using a different fold for evaluation each time. Average the performance across all folds to get the final estimate.

**Key Benefits:**
- Improves code organization and maintainability
- Enhances system capabilities
- Aligns with industry best practices

## Implementation Status

This is a **Tier 0 basic placeholder**. Full implementation requires:
1. Detailed code generation (Tier 1+)
2. Comprehensive test suite (Tier 1+)
3. Integration with nba-simulator-aws (Phase 9)
4. Validation and testing (Phase 8.5)

---

## Quick Start

```python
# Basic implementation placeholder
# Full code will be generated in Tier 1+

class ImplementCrossValidationForModelEvaluation:
    """

    """

    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def setup(self):
        """Initialize system."""
        pass

    def execute(self):
        """Execute main workflow."""
        pass
