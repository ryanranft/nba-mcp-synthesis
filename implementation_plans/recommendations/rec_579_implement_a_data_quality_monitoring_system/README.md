## Overview

Implement a data quality monitoring system to track the quality of the input data used by the NBA analytics system. This system should monitor for issues such as missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Implement automated checks to detect these issues and generate alerts when data quality falls below a certain threshold.

**Key Benefits:**
- Improves code organization and maintainability
- Enhances system capabilities
- Aligns with industry best practices

## Implementation Status

This is a **Tier 0 basic placeholder**. Full implementation requires:
1. Detailed code generation (Tier 1+)
2. Comprehensive test suite (Tier 1+)
3. Integration with nba-simulator-aws (Phase 9)
4. Validation and testing (Phase 8.5)

---

## Quick Start

```python
# Basic implementation placeholder
# Full code will be generated in Tier 1+

class ImplementADataQualityMonitoringSystem:
    """
    Implement a Data Quality Monitoring System.

    Based on: ECONOMETRICS A Modern Approach
    """

    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def setup(self):
        """Initialize system."""
        pass

    def execute(self):
        """Execute main workflow."""
        pass
```
