# Implement a Difference-in-Differences (DID) Estimator to Evaluate Policy Changes

**Status:** ‚è≥ PENDING IMPLEMENTATION
**Source Book:** Wooldridge   Cross section and Panel Data
**Category:** Statistics
**Created:** 2025-10-23T14:55:50.319376

## Overview

Use difference-in-differences to analyze the impact of policy changes (e.g., rule changes, new training programs) on player or team performance. DID compares the change in outcomes for a treatment group (affected by the policy) to the change in outcomes for a control group (not affected by the policy).

**Key Benefits:**
- Improves code organization and maintainability
- Enhances system capabilities
- Aligns with industry best practices

## Implementation Status

This is a **Tier 0 basic placeholder**. Full implementation requires:
1. Detailed code generation (Tier 1+)
2. Comprehensive test suite (Tier 1+)
3. Integration with nba-simulator-aws (Phase 9)
4. Validation and testing (Phase 8.5)

## Quick Start

```python
# Basic implementation placeholder
# Full code will be generated in Tier 1+

class ImplementADifferenceInDifferencesDidEstimato:
    """
