## Overview

Apply Statistical Process Control (SPC) techniques to identify anomalies in player performance metrics. This involves establishing control limits based on historical data and flagging data points that fall outside these limits. This can be used to determine if a player is performing above or below expectations.

**Key Benefits:**
- Improves code organization and maintainability
- Enhances system capabilities
- Aligns with industry best practices

## Implementation Status

This is a **Tier 0 basic placeholder**. Full implementation requires:
1. Detailed code generation (Tier 1+)
2. Comprehensive test suite (Tier 1+)
3. Integration with nba-simulator-aws (Phase 9)
4. Validation and testing (Phase 8.5)

---

## Quick Start

```python
# Basic implementation placeholder
# Full code will be generated in Tier 1+

class ImplementStatisticalProcessControlSpcForAnom:
    """

    Based on: AI Engineering
    """

    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def setup(self):
        """Initialize system."""
        pass

    def execute(self):
        """Execute main workflow."""
        pass
```
