Implement Initial Heuristics-Based Prototype for NBA Player Performance Prediction

Source: building machine learning powered applications going from idea to product
Category: ML

This is a Tier 0 basic placeholder.
Full implementation will be generated in Tier 1+ with AI assistance.

Description:
Before applying ML, create a rule-based system leveraging basketball domain knowledge to establish a baseline for predicting player performance metrics (e.g., points per game, assists). This allows for a quick MVP and a benchmark against which to measure future ML model improvements.
