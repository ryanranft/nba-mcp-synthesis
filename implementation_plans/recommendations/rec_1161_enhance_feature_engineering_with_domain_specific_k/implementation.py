Enhance Feature Engineering with Domain-Specific Knowledge

Source: Anaconda Sponsored Manning Generative AI in Action
Category: Data Processing

This is a Tier 0 basic placeholder.
Full implementation will be generated in Tier 1+ with AI assistance.

Description:
Incorporate domain-specific knowledge from basketball experts (coaches, analysts) into the feature engineering process. This can lead to the creation of more meaningful and relevant features that improve model performance.
