## Overview

Create an interactive data visualization dashboard to explore and analyze NBA data. This dashboard will allow users to visualize player statistics, game outcomes, and model predictions, and to identify trends and patterns.

**Key Benefits:**
- Improves code organization and maintainability
- Enhances system capabilities
- Aligns with industry best practices

## Implementation Status

This is a **Tier 0 basic placeholder**. Full implementation requires:
1. Detailed code generation (Tier 1+)
2. Comprehensive test suite (Tier 1+)
3. Integration with nba-simulator-aws (Phase 9)
4. Validation and testing (Phase 8.5)

---

## Quick Start

```python
# Basic implementation placeholder
# Full code will be generated in Tier 1+

class DevelopADataVisualizationDashboard:
    """
    Develop a Data Visualization Dashboard.

    Based on: Bishop Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning 2006
    """

    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def setup(self):
        """Initialize system."""
        pass

    def execute(self):
        """Execute main workflow."""
        pass
```
