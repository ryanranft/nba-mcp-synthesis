# Use Cross-Validation for Robust Model Evaluation

**Status:** ⏳ PENDING IMPLEMENTATION
**Source Book:** ML Machine Learning A Probabilistic Perspective
**Category:** Testing

## Overview

Implement cross-validation techniques, such as k-fold cross-validation or stratified cross-validation, to obtain a more robust estimate of model performance. This helps to avoid overfitting and ensures that the model generalizes well to unseen data.

**Key Benefits:**
- Improves code organization and maintainability
- Enhances system capabilities
- Aligns with industry best practices

## Implementation Status

This is a **Tier 0 basic placeholder**. Full implementation requires:
1. Detailed code generation (Tier 1+)
2. Comprehensive test suite (Tier 1+)
3. Integration with nba-simulator-aws (Phase 9)
4. Validation and testing (Phase 8.5)

---

## Quick Start

```python
# Basic implementation placeholder
# Full code will be generated in Tier 1+

class UseCrossValidationForRobustModelEvaluation:
    """
    Use Cross-Validation for Robust Model Evaluation.

    Based on: ML Machine Learning A Probabilistic Perspective
    """

    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def setup(self):
        """Initialize system."""
        pass

    def execute(self):
        """Execute main workflow."""
        pass
```
