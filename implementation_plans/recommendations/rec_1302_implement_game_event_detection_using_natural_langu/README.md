## Overview

Apply Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to automatically extract and classify key game events from textual data like play-by-play descriptions or sports articles. This allows for a richer understanding of game context.

**Key Benefits:**
- Improves code organization and maintainability
- Enhances system capabilities
- Aligns with industry best practices

## Implementation Status

This is a **Tier 0 basic placeholder**. Full implementation requires:
1. Detailed code generation (Tier 1+)
2. Comprehensive test suite (Tier 1+)
3. Integration with nba-simulator-aws (Phase 9)
4. Validation and testing (Phase 8.5)

---

## Quick Start

```python
# Basic implementation placeholder
# Full code will be generated in Tier 1+

class ImplementGameEventDetectionUsingNaturalLangu:
    """
    Implement Game Event Detection using Natural Language Processing.

    Based on: Artificial Intelligence   A Modern Approach (3rd Edition)
    """

    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def setup(self):
        """Initialize system."""
        pass

    def execute(self):
        """Execute main workflow."""
        pass
```
