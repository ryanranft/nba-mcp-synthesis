## Overview

Implement data encryption at rest and in transit to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access. This includes encrypting data stored in databases, file systems, and cloud storage, as well as encrypting data transmitted over the network.

**Key Benefits:**
- Improves code organization and maintainability
- Enhances system capabilities
- Aligns with industry best practices

---

## Implementation Status

This is a **Tier 0 basic placeholder**. Full implementation requires:
1. Detailed code generation (Tier 1+)
2. Comprehensive test suite (Tier 1+)
3. Integration with nba-simulator-aws (Phase 9)
4. Validation and testing (Phase 8.5)

---

## Quick Start

```python
# Basic implementation placeholder
# Full code will be generated in Tier 1+

class ImplementDataEncryptionAtRestAndInTransit:
    """
    Implement Data Encryption at Rest and in Transit.

    Based on: Artificial Intelligence   A Modern Approach (3rd Edition)
    """

    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def setup(self):
        """Initialize system."""
        pass

    def execute(self):
        """Execute main workflow."""
        pass
```
