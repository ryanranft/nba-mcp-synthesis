## Overview

Create a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate player skill levels while accounting for the nested structure of the data (e.g., players within teams, games within seasons). This allows for borrowing strength across different levels and provides more accurate and robust skill estimates.

**Key Benefits:**
- Improves code organization and maintainability
- Enhances system capabilities
- Aligns with industry best practices

## Implementation Status

This is a **Tier 0 basic placeholder**. Full implementation requires:
1. Detailed code generation (Tier 1+)
2. Comprehensive test suite (Tier 1+)
3. Integration with nba-simulator-aws (Phase 9)
4. Validation and testing (Phase 8.5)

---

## Quick Start

```python
# Basic implementation placeholder
# Full code will be generated in Tier 1+

class DevelopABayesianHierarchicalModelForPlayerS:
    """
    Develop a Bayesian Hierarchical Model for Player Skill Assessment.

    Based on: Probabilistic Machine Learning Advanced Topics... (Z Library)
    """

    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def setup(self):
        """Initialize system."""
        pass

    def execute(self):
        """Execute main workflow."""
        pass
```
