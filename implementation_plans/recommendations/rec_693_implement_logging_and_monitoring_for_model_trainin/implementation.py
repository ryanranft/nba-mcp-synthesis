Implement Logging and Monitoring for Model Training and Deployment

Source: Deep Learning by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, Aaron Courville
Category: Monitoring

This is a Tier 0 basic placeholder.
Full implementation will be generated in Tier 1+ with AI assistance.

Description:
Implement logging and monitoring mechanisms to track the performance of machine learning models during training and after deployment. This includes logging metrics like loss, accuracy, and training time, as well as monitoring resource usage and system health.
