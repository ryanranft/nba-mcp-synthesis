## Overview

Calculate confidence intervals for player performance metrics (e.g., points per game, rebounds) to quantify the uncertainty in the estimates. This provides a range of plausible values for the true performance.

**Key Benefits:**
- Improves code organization and maintainability
- Enhances system capabilities
- Aligns with industry best practices

## Implementation Status

This is a **Tier 0 basic placeholder**. Full implementation requires:
1. Detailed code generation (Tier 1+)
2. Comprehensive test suite (Tier 1+)
3. Integration with nba-simulator-aws (Phase 9)
4. Validation and testing (Phase 8.5)

---

## Quick Start

```python
# Basic implementation placeholder
# Full code will be generated in Tier 1+

class ImplementConfidenceIntervalsForPlayerPerforma:
    """
    Implement Confidence Intervals for Player Performance Metrics.

    Based on: Bishop Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning 2006
    """

    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def setup(self):
        """Initialize system."""
        pass

    def execute(self):
        """Execute main workflow."""
        pass
```
