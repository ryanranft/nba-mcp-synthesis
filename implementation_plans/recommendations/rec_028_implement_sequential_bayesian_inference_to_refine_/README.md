## Overview

Employ sequential Bayesian inference for real-time updates of player skill levels and team strengths as new game data become available.  This technique models prior values and allows for incorporating learning over time. 

**Key Benefits:**
- Improves code organization and maintainability
- Enhances system capabilities
- Aligns with industry best practices

---

## Implementation Status

This is a **Tier 0 basic placeholder**. Full implementation requires:
1. Detailed code generation (Tier 1+)
2. Comprehensive test suite (Tier 1+)
3. Integration with nba-simulator-aws (Phase 9)
4. Validation and testing (Phase 8.5)

---

## Quick Start

```python
# Basic implementation placeholder
# Full code will be generated in Tier 1+

class ImplementSequentialBayesianInferenceToRefine:
    """
    Implement Sequential Bayesian Inference to Refine Real-Time Player Valuations.

    Based on: STATISTICS 601 Advanced Statistical Methods ( PDFDrive )
    """

    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def setup(self):
        """Initialize system."""
        pass

    def execute(self):
        """Execute main workflow."""
        pass
```
