# Perform Tests for Heteroskedasticity

**Status:** ⏳ PENDING IMPLEMENTATION
**Source Book:** Introductory Econometrics 7E 2020
**Category:** Statistics

## Overview

Implement formal tests for heteroskedasticity, such as the Breusch-Pagan test, White test, or Goldfeld-Quandt test, before running regression models. This will help determine if heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors are necessary.

**Key Benefits:**
- Improves code organization and maintainability
- Enhances system capabilities
- Aligns with industry best practices

---

## Implementation Status

This is a **Tier 0 basic placeholder**. Full implementation requires:
1. Detailed code generation (Tier 1+)
2. Comprehensive test suite (Tier 1+)
3. Integration with nba-simulator-aws (Phase 9)
4. Validation and testing (Phase 8.5)

---

## Quick Start

```python
# Basic implementation placeholder
# Full code will be generated in Tier 1+

class PerformTestsForHeteroskedasticity:
    """
    Perform Tests for Heteroskedasticity.

    Based on: Introductory Econometrics 7E 2020
    """

    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def setup(self):
        """Initialize system."""
        pass

    def execute(self):
        """Execute main workflow."""
        pass
```
