## Overview

Utilize Statistical Process Control charts (e.g., X-bar chart, S chart) to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) such as player efficiency rating (PER), team scoring margin, or game win percentage. SPC charts help identify statistically significant deviations from expected performance levels, indicating potential issues or areas for improvement.  This can be used for real-time monitoring of team and player performance.

**Key Benefits:**
- Improves code organization and maintainability
- Enhances system capabilities
- Aligns with industry best practices

## Implementation Status

This is a **Tier 0 basic placeholder**. Full implementation requires:
1. Detailed code generation (Tier 1+)
2. Comprehensive test suite (Tier 1+)
3. Integration with nba-simulator-aws (Phase 9)
4. Validation and testing (Phase 8.5)

## Quick Start

```python
# Basic implementation placeholder
# Full code will be generated in Tier 1+

class ImplementAStatisticalProcessControlSpcChart:
    """
