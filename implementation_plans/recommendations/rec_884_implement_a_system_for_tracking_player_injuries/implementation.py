Implement a System for Tracking Player Injuries

Source: Bishop Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning 2006
Category: Data Processing

This is a Tier 0 basic placeholder.
Full implementation will be generated in Tier 1+ with AI assistance.

Description:
Develop a system to track player injuries and their impact on team performance. This system will allow users to analyze the relationship between injuries and game outcomes, and to predict the impact of injuries on future performance.
