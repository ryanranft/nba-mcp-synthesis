# Implement a Model Interpretability Framework using SHAP or LIME

**Status:** ‚è≥ PENDING IMPLEMENTATION
**Source Book:** Bishop Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning 2006
**Category:** ML

## Overview

Apply SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) or LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) to understand and explain the predictions made by complex machine learning models used for player performance analysis or game outcome prediction.

**Key Benefits:**
- Improves code organization and maintainability
- Enhances system capabilities
- Aligns with industry best practices

---

## Implementation Status

This is a **Tier 0 basic placeholder**. Full implementation requires:
1. Detailed code generation (Tier 1+)
2. Comprehensive test suite (Tier 1+)
3. Integration with nba-simulator-aws (Phase 9)
4. Validation and testing (Phase 8.5)

---

## Quick Start

```python
# Basic implementation placeholder
# Full code will be generated in Tier 1+

class ImplementAModelInterpretabilityFrameworkUsing:
    """

    Based on: Bishop Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning 2006
    """

    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def setup(self):
        """Initialize system."""
        pass

    def execute(self):
        """Execute main workflow."""
        pass
```
