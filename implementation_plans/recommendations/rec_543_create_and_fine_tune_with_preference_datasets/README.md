# Create and Fine-Tune with Preference Datasets

**Status:** ‚è≥ PENDING IMPLEMENTATION
**Source Book:** LLM Engineers Handbook
**Category:** ML
**Created:** 2025-10-23T14:55:50.428430

## Overview

Generate a new preference dataset and align the model with human preference using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). This should enhance the model's nuanced understanding of user requests and their satisfaction.

**Key Benefits:**
- Improves code organization and maintainability
- Enhances system capabilities
- Aligns with industry best practices

## Implementation Status

This is a **Tier 0 basic placeholder**. Full implementation requires:
1. Detailed code generation (Tier 1+)
2. Comprehensive test suite (Tier 1+)
3. Integration with nba-simulator-aws (Phase 9)
4. Validation and testing (Phase 8.5)

---

## Quick Start

```python
# Basic implementation placeholder
# Full code will be generated in Tier 1+

class CreateAndFineTuneWithPreferenceDatasets:
    """
    Create and Fine-Tune with Preference Datasets.

    Based on: LLM Engineers Handbook
    """

    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def setup(self):
        """Initialize system."""
        pass

    def execute(self):
        """Execute main workflow."""
        pass
```
