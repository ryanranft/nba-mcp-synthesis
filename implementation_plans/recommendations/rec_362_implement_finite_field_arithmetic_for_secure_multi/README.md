## Overview

Use finite field arithmetic for secure multiparty computation (MPC) to perform computations on sensitive data (e.g., player salaries, medical information) without revealing the data to any single party. This enables collaborative analysis and modeling while preserving privacy.

**Key Benefits:**
- Improves code organization and maintainability
- Enhances system capabilities
- Aligns with industry best practices

## Implementation Status

This is a **Tier 0 basic placeholder**. Full implementation requires:
1. Detailed code generation (Tier 1+)
2. Comprehensive test suite (Tier 1+)
3. Integration with nba-simulator-aws (Phase 9)
4. Validation and testing (Phase 8.5)

---

## Quick Start

```python
# Basic implementation placeholder
# Full code will be generated in Tier 1+

class ImplementFiniteFieldArithmeticForSecureMulti:
    """
    Implement Finite Field Arithmetic for Secure Multiparty Computation.

    Based on: Mathematics for Computer Science Eric Lehman
    """

    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def setup(self):
        """Initialize system."""
        pass

    def execute(self):
        """Execute main workflow."""
        pass
```
