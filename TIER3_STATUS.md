## Current Decision Point

### Option A: Analyze New Books Now ⭐ RECOMMENDED

**Action:**
```bash
python3 scripts/run_full_workflow.py --parallel --max-workers 4 --book "All Books"
```

**Outcome:**
- Analyze 11 new books with high-context analyzer
- 100% cache hits on existing 40 books
- Generate recommendations for all 51 books

**Cost:** ~$16.50 (11 new books × $1.50)
**Time:** ~20-30 minutes (parallel execution)
**Value:** Complete analysis of expanded catalog

**Why Recommended:**
- Immediate value from discovered books
- Leverages existing infrastructure
- Low cost for high return
- Prepares data for future Tier 3 features

---

### Option B: Manual Review First

**Action:**
1. Manually inspect 11 low-confidence books
2. Categorize and add to configuration
3. Run analysis on all 62 books

**Outcome:**
- Maximum catalog size (62 books, +55% from original)
- Higher confidence in categorization
- Potential for better recommendations

**Cost:** ~$33.00 (22 new books × $1.50)
**Time:** ~15 min manual + 40 min analysis
**Value:** Comprehensive catalog with manual QA

---

### Option C: Continue to Tier 3 Features

**Action:**
1. Implement Feature 3: Real A/B Test Integration
2. Run comparison test to optimize model selection
3. Apply optimized configuration to full workflow

**Outcome:**
- Optimized model configuration
- Data-driven decision making
- Potential cost savings on future analyses

**Cost:** ~$2-5 (A/B test) + ~$16.50 (new books) = ~$18.50-21.50
**Time:** ~35-50 min (integration) + 20-30 min (analysis) = ~55-80 min
**Value:** Scientific approach to optimization

---

### Option D: Skip Tier 3 Remaining → Proceed to Production

**Action:**
- Mark Tier 3 as "core features complete"
- Deploy Smart Book Discovery as scheduled job
- Proceed with analyzing books as they're discovered

**Outcome:**
- Production-ready automation
- Iterative catalog growth
- Focus on Tier 2 deployment or other priorities

**Cost:** $0.00 immediate (future analyses as needed)
**Time:** Immediate
**Value:** Move to production, iterate later

   - **Path D** (Iterative): Deploy automation → Analyze incrementally

### Short-Term (This Month)

1. Schedule Smart Book Discovery (weekly or monthly cron job)
2. Manual review of 11 low-confidence books
3. Optionally: Implement Feature 3 (Real A/B Test Integration)

### Long-Term (Future Iterations)

1. Feature 4: GitHub Repository Analysis Enhancement
