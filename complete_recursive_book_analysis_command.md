PHASE 0: NBA-SIMULATOR-AWS PROJECT DISCOVERY (MUST COMPLETE FIRST)
Before analyzing any books, thoroughly understand the NBA-Simulator-AWS project:

1. **Workflow Analysis**
   - Read all workflow files in `/Users/ryanranft/nba-simulator-aws/`
   - Understand existing automation and processes
   - Learn how phases interact and dependencies flow

2. **File Structure Understanding**
   - Scan `/Users/ryanranft/nba-simulator-aws/docs/phases/` structure
   - Read all `PHASE_X_INDEX.md` files to understand current phase organization
   - Review all sub-phase directories and their purposes
   - Understand file naming conventions and organization patterns

3. **Progress Indexing System**
   - Read `PROGRESS.md` or equivalent progress tracking files
   - Understand how implementation progress is tracked
   - Learn the status indicators and completion criteria

4. **Archive System**
   - Locate and understand archive directories
   - Learn archival rules and when/how to archive content
   - Understand how to safely delete obsolete content using archives

5. **Project Vision & Mission**
   - Read project vision documents
   - **Core Mission**: Accurately predict box scores, player stats, final scores, and team stats
   - Understand the multi-level model approach from "Beyond Linear Regression" Chapter 8
   - Learn how models can be:
     - Period-specific (certain times of the year)
     - Weight-based for different conditions
     - Combined into ensemble predictions
     - Incorporated into the final prediction system

6. **Model Architecture Understanding**
   - Review existing model structures
   - Understand how multiple models combine for final predictions
   - Learn about period-specific model capabilities
   - Understand weighting and ensemble strategies

PHASE 1: BOOK DISCOVERY & UPLOAD
1. Scan my Downloads folder for any new PDF books not yet in S3
2. Upload any missing books to S3 bucket nba-mcp-books-20251011
3. Update the book configuration with any new discoveries

PHASE 2: COMPLETE SECTION-BY-SECTION RECURSIVE BOOK ANALYSIS (ALL 42 BOOKS)
For each of the 42 books in S3, run complete section-by-section analysis:

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
- **Read each book completely** from start to finish
- **Analyze by sections** (chapters, major sections, or logical divisions)
- **For each section**:
  - Read the entire section content
  - Analyze against NBA MCP project and current NBA-simulator-aws phases
  - **Special attention to multi-level models** (Beyond Linear Regression Chapter 8)
  - Generate recommendations aligned with prediction mission (box scores, player stats, team stats)
  - Continue analysis iterations until 3 consecutive iterations produce ONLY Nice-to-Have recommendations
  - Track convergence per section
  - Move to next section only after current section achieves convergence
- **Complete book tracking**: Ensure every section is read and analyzed
- **Section-level convergence**: Each section must achieve its own convergence before moving on
- **Full book completion**: Do not consider a book complete until all sections have been analyzed

**Section-by-Section Analysis Process:**
For each book:
1. Extract table of contents to identify all sections
2. Read sections sequentially from start to finish
3. For each section:
   a. Read complete section content
   b. Analyze against current NBA MCP and NBA-simulator-aws state
   c. Consider project mission (box score, player stats, team stats prediction)
   d. Identify multi-level model opportunities (period-specific, weighted, ensemble)
   e. Generate recommendations
   f. Iterate analysis until 3 consecutive nice-to-have-only iterations
   g. Mark section as complete with convergence achieved
   h. Move to next section
4. Mark book as complete only when all sections analyzed
5. Generate per-book summary with section-level convergence data
3. Generate recommendations categorized as:
   - Critical (security, stability, legal, core functionality)
   - Important (performance, testing, documentation, scalability)
   - Nice-to-Have (polish, examples, UI improvements)
4. Continue until convergence (3 consecutive iterations producing ONLY Nice-to-Have)
5. Track all iterations in detailed JSON logs
6. Generate per-book analysis reports

PHASE 3: NBA-SIMULATOR-AWS PHASE INTEGRATION WITH MODIFICATION AUTHORITY
Use the existing integration workflow to organize recommendations into NBA-Simulator-AWS phase structure:

**Phase Modification Authority:**
You have FULL PERMISSION to:
- **Add new phases** if recommendations don't fit existing structure (phase_10, phase_11, etc.)
- **Modify existing phases** by updating phase scope, goals, or priorities
- **Delete obsolete phases** using archive system if recommendations indicate they're no longer needed
- **Change phase ordering** if logical flow needs adjustment
- **Reorganize sub-phases** within phases
- **Create new model phases** for multi-level modeling (period-specific, weighted, ensemble)

**Phase Modification Rules:**
1. Review existing phases 0-9 in NBA-simulator-aws
2. Review project workflows, file structure, progress indexing, and archive system
3. If recommendations don't fit existing phases:
   - CREATE new phase_X with appropriate scope
   - Document justification in PROPOSED_UPDATES.md
   - Update progress tracking
4. If existing phases need updates:
   - MODIFY phase scope, goals, or structure
   - Document changes in PROPOSED_UPDATES.md
   - Update all cross-references
5. If phases are obsolete or redundant:
   - USE archive system to preserve content
   - MARK for deletion in PROPOSED_UPDATES.md
   - Provide migration path for existing content
6. If phase ordering needs adjustment:
   - REORGANIZE phase sequence
   - Update all cross-references
   - Maintain logical dependency flow
7. For multi-level model recommendations:
   - CREATE model-specific phases or sub-phases
   - Document period-specific model strategies
   - Define weighting and ensemble approaches
   - Align with prediction mission (box scores, player stats, team stats)
8. Always maintain:
   - Clear phase boundaries
   - Logical dependency flow
   - Comprehensive documentation
   - Archive of deleted content
   - Progress tracking integrity

1. Run recommendation integration script:
   python3 scripts/integrate_recommendations.py --synthesis-path /Users/ryanranft/nba-mcp-synthesis --simulator-path /Users/ryanranft/nba-simulator-aws

2. Generate phase-specific files in NBA-Simulator-AWS structure:
   /Users/ryanranft/nba-simulator-aws/docs/phases/phase_0/RECOMMENDATIONS_FROM_BOOKS.md
   /Users/ryanranft/nba-simulator-aws/docs/phases/phase_1/RECOMMENDATIONS_FROM_BOOKS.md
   /Users/ryanranft/nba-simulator-aws/docs/phases/phase_2/RECOMMENDATIONS_FROM_BOOKS.md
   /Users/ryanranft/nba-simulator-aws/docs/phases/phase_3/RECOMMENDATIONS_FROM_BOOKS.md

   /Users/ryanranft/nba-simulator-aws/docs/phases/phase_1/1.1_data_validation/RECOMMENDATIONS_FROM_BOOKS.md
   /Users/ryanranft/nba-simulator-aws/docs/phases/phase_1/1.2_quality_checks/RECOMMENDATIONS_FROM_BOOKS.md
   (Continue for all existing sub-phases in phases 0-9)

PHASE 4: IMPLEMENTATION FILE GENERATION
Generate actual implementation files using MCP tools:

1. Run implementation generator:
   python3 scripts/generate_implementation_files.py --recommendations analysis_results/master_recommendations.json --output-base /Users/ryanranft/nba-simulator-aws/docs/phases --mcp-server http://localhost:8000

2. Create phase-specific implementation files:

   - Database schemas (SQL)
   - Infrastructure files (CloudFormation/Docker)
   - **Generate model files** for multi-level prediction systems:
     - Period-specific models (seasonal, monthly, game-type)
     - Weighted ensemble models
     - Box score prediction models
     - Player stats prediction models
     - Team stats prediction models

PHASE 5: PHASE INDEX UPDATES
Update all phase index files with new recommendations:

1. Update PHASE_X_INDEX.md files with Book Recommendations sections
2. Create new phase indexes for any newly added phases
3. Generate PROPOSED_UPDATES.md for any conflicts requiring manual review
4. Create BOOK_RECOMMENDATIONS_INDEX.md in each phase directory
5. Update progress tracking with new implementations

PHASE 6: CROSS-PROJECT STATUS
Generate comprehensive status reports:

1. Create CROSS_PROJECT_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md
2. Update integration_summary.md
3. Generate master implementation roadmap
4. Document all phase structure changes
5. **Document model integration strategy** for prediction mission
