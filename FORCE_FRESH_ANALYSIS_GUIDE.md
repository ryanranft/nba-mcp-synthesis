# Force Fresh Analysis Guide

## Overview

The `--force-fresh` flag forces the workflow to bypass all caching mechanisms and perform a complete fresh analysis of all books. This is essential for true convergence enhancement runs where you want to ensure books are re-analyzed with new settings (e.g., increased iteration limits).

---

## When to Use Force-Fresh

### ✅ Use Force-Fresh When:
1. **Validating convergence improvements** - Testing if increased iteration limits yield more recommendations
2. **After configuration changes** - Changed max_iterations, convergence_threshold, etc.
3. **Debugging caching issues** - Suspect cached results are being used incorrectly
4. **First-time convergence enhancement** - Ensuring all books get full analysis with new settings
5. **Quality assurance** - Verifying results are reproducible without cache

### ❌ Don't Use Force-Fresh When:
1. **Quick testing** - Testing workflow changes that don't affect analysis
2. **Already converged** - Books have reached convergence with current settings
3. **Time-constrained** - Need results quickly and cached data is acceptable
4. **Cost-constrained** - Avoiding unnecessary API costs

---

## How It Works

### Without --force-fresh (Normal Mode)
```
1. Check if convergence_tracker.json exists for book
2. If exists and converged → Skip analysis
3. If exists but not converged → Resume from checkpoint
4. If doesn't exist → Run fresh analysis
```

### With --force-fresh
```
1. Ignore any existing convergence_tracker.json
2. Delete cached analysis results
3. Start analysis from iteration 0
4. Run full convergence enhancement
```

---

## Usage

### Command Line
```bash
# Single book with force-fresh
python3 scripts/run_full_workflow.py \
    --book "Designing Machine Learning Systems" \
    --force-fresh

# All books with force-fresh (overnight run)
python3 scripts/run_full_workflow.py \
    --parallel \
    --max-workers 4 \
    --force-fresh
```

### Via Launch Script
The `launch_overnight_convergence.sh` script **now includes --force-fresh by default**:

```bash
# This automatically uses --force-fresh
./launch_overnight_convergence.sh
```

## Impact on Runtime & Cost

### Runtime Impact
| Books | Normal Mode | Force-Fresh Mode |
|-------|-------------|------------------|
| 1 book | 5-10 min | 10-20 min |
| 51 books (parallel) | 6-8 hours | 10-15 hours |

**Why slower?**
- Re-analyzes all books from scratch
- No checkpoint resumption
- Full convergence iterations (up to 200)

### Cost Impact
| Scenario | Normal Mode | Force-Fresh Mode |
|----------|-------------|------------------|
| Single book | $0.50 - $2.00 | $1.00 - $4.00 |
| 51 books | $50 - $150 | $150 - $250 |

**Why more expensive?**
- More API calls (no cache hits)
- More iterations per book
- More token usage

## Expected Behavior

### Visual Indicators
```
⚠️  FORCE FRESH MODE ENABLED - All caching bypassed
   This ensures true convergence enhancement but may be slower

🔄 Phase 2: Book Analysis
   📖 Analyzing: Designing Machine Learning Systems
   🔄 Iteration 1/200: Found 12 recommendations (0 new, 12 total)
   🔄 Iteration 2/200: Found 8 recommendations (8 new, 20 total)
   ...
   ✅ Converged after 45 iterations (152 recommendations)
```

### Log Verification
Check logs to confirm force-fresh is working:
```bash
# Should see "FORCE FRESH MODE ENABLED"
grep "FORCE FRESH" logs/overnight_convergence_*.log

# Should see iteration counts starting from 0
grep "Iteration 1/200" logs/overnight_convergence_*.log
```

---

## Verification

### Before Running
```bash
# Check if force-fresh flag is available
python3 scripts/run_full_workflow.py --help | grep force-fresh

# Expected output:
#   --force-fresh         Force fresh analysis, bypass all caching
```

### After Running
```bash
# Validate with system health check
python3 scripts/validate_mcp_structure.py

# Check convergence results
ls -lh analysis_results/*_convergence_tracker.json

# Each tracker should show recent timestamps
python3 -c "
import json
from pathlib import Path
from datetime import datetime

for tracker in Path('analysis_results').glob('*_convergence_tracker.json'):
    data = json.load(open(tracker))
    print(f\"{tracker.stem}: {data.get('iterations_completed', 0)} iterations\")
"
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Force-Fresh Not Working
**Symptom:** Analysis completes instantly, no new iterations
**Cause:** Cache not being cleared properly
**Solution:**
```bash
# Manually clear analysis results
rm -rf analysis_results/*_convergence_tracker.json
rm -rf analysis_results/*_analysis.json

# Run again with force-fresh
python3 scripts/run_full_workflow.py --force-fresh
```

### Issue: Still Seeing "Skipped - Already Converged"
**Symptom:** Books show as skipped despite force-fresh
**Cause:** Phase status not reset
**Solution:**
```bash
# Reset phase status
rm -f implementation_plans/phase_status.json

# Run again with force-fresh
python3 scripts/run_full_workflow.py --force-fresh
```

### Issue: Running Out of API Quota
**Symptom:** API errors, rate limiting
**Cause:** Force-fresh uses more API calls
**Solution:**
```bash
# Reduce parallel workers
python3 scripts/run_full_workflow.py \
    --parallel \
    --max-workers 2 \
    --force-fresh

# Or run fewer books at a time
python3 scripts/run_full_workflow.py \
    --book "Book1,Book2,Book3" \
    --force-fresh
```

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Plan Ahead
- Schedule force-fresh runs during off-peak hours
- Ensure you have sufficient API quota
- Allocate 10-15 hours for full 51-book runs

### 2. Monitor Progress
```bash
# Use the dashboard
# (In separate terminal)
python3 scripts/workflow_monitor.py

# Or use check_progress script
./check_progress.sh
```

### 3. Validate Results
```bash
# After completion, check for improvements
python3 scripts/generate_convergence_comparison.py

# Should show:
# - More recommendations per book
# - Higher convergence rates
# - Increased iteration counts
```

### 4. Document Runs
```bash
# Before running
python3 scripts/generate_summary.py > pre_force_fresh_summary.txt

# After running
python3 scripts/generate_summary.py > post_force_fresh_summary.txt

# Compare
diff pre_force_fresh_summary.txt post_force_fresh_summary.txt
```

## Configuration

### Workflow Config
Force-fresh respects convergence settings in `config/workflow_config.yaml`:

```yaml
phase_2:
  convergence:
    enabled: true
    max_iterations: 200        # Force-fresh will run up to 200 iterations
    convergence_threshold: 3   # Stop if <3 new recs for 3 iterations
    min_recommendations_per_iteration: 2
    force_convergence: true    # Don't stop until truly converged
```

### Cost Limits
Even with force-fresh, cost limits are enforced:

```yaml
cost_limits:
  phase_2_analysis: 300.00     # Per-book limit
  total_workflow: 400.00       # Overall limit
```

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Single Book Validation
```bash
# Test force-fresh on one book
python3 scripts/run_full_workflow.py \
    --book "Designing Machine Learning Systems" \
    --force-fresh

# Expected: 10-20 minutes, $1-4 cost
# Outcome: Verify increased recommendations vs cached run
```

### Example 2: Overnight Full Convergence
```bash
# Run all 51 books with force-fresh
./launch_overnight_convergence.sh

# Expected: 10-15 hours, $150-250 cost
# Outcome: True convergence enhancement across all books
```

### Example 3: Partial Re-Analysis
```bash
# Re-analyze specific books that didn't converge
python3 scripts/run_full_workflow.py \
    --book "Book1,Book2,Book3" \
    --force-fresh \
    --parallel

# Expected: 1-2 hours, $10-20 cost
# Outcome: Focused improvement on problem books
```

## FAQ

**Q: Do I need force-fresh for every run?**
A: No. Only use it when you've changed convergence settings or need to verify true convergence.

**Q: Can I cancel a force-fresh run?**
A: Yes. Press Ctrl+C or send SIGTERM. Progress is checkpointed, but you'll need to use --force-fresh again to restart.

**Q: Will force-fresh delete my existing recommendations?**
A: No. It only affects convergence_tracker.json files. Generated recommendations are preserved.

**Q: How do I know if force-fresh actually worked?**
A: Check logs for "FORCE FRESH MODE ENABLED" and verify iteration counts start from 1.

**Q: Can I use force-fresh with --dry-run?**
A: Yes. Dry-run will preview the workflow but won't actually run analysis or clear cache.

---

## Summary

**Force-fresh is essential for validating convergence improvements.**

✅ **Use it for:** Overnight runs, testing new settings, quality assurance
❌ **Skip it for:** Quick tests, iterative development, cost savings

**Default behavior:** `launch_overnight_convergence.sh` includes --force-fresh automatically.

For questions or issues, refer to the validation script:
```bash
python3 scripts/validate_mcp_structure.py
```
