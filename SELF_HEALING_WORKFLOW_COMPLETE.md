- **Error analysis** and recommendations
- **Detailed test reports**

### 4. **Deployment Manager** (`scripts/deployment_manager.py`)

### 5. **Master Orchestrator** (`scripts/master_self_healing_orchestrator.py`)
- **Complete workflow orchestration**
- **Iterative testing** until success threshold reached
- **Automatic fixes** based on issue analysis
- **Success validation** (80% success rate required)
- **Final reporting** with comprehensive metrics

### 6. **Focused Working Model Workflow** (`scripts/focused_working_model_workflow.py`)
- **Single-model testing** using only working models
- **Consistency validation** with multiple tests
- **Performance benchmarking**
- **Reliability assessment**
