# Archive Location

**Gitignored files are automatically archived to:**

`/Users/ryanranft/nba-mcp-archives/`

**Archive system:**
- Organized by git commit SHA
- Auto-populated by post-commit hooks
- Includes: status files, completion docs, test results, logs

**To access archives:**

2. Navigate to: `~/nba-mcp-archives/<commit-sha>/`
3. Browse gitignored files from that commit

**Example:**
```bash
cd ~/nba-mcp-archives/9e3c4e2/
ls -la  # See all archived files from this commit
```
