## Usage Examples

### How Teams Can Use These Notebooks Today

**Scenario 1: Player Performance Analyst**
```python
# Load player data from database
player_df = load_player_data('lebron_james', seasons=5)

# Run Notebook 1 with real data
# Replace synthetic data generation with:
points_df = player_df

# Execute all cells → Get forecasts, trend analysis, regime detection
```

**Scenario 2: Front Office Decision Maker**
```python
# Load coaching change data
coaching_data = load_team_history(include_coaching=True)

# Run Notebook 3 for causal analysis
# Replace synthetic data with real data

# Output: Coaching change recommendation with confidence intervals
# Example: "Expected win improvement: +6.2 wins (95% CI: [3.1, 9.3])"
```

**Scenario 3: Medical Staff**
```python
# Load injury/recovery data
injury_df = load_injury_data(player_id='kawhi_leonard')

# Run Notebook 4
# Estimate recovery timeline
# Identify current recovery phase

# Output: "Player is in Recovering phase (72% probability)"
#         "Expected return to Healthy phase: 8 games"
```

**Scenario 4: Team Chemistry Analysis**
```python
# Load team performance metrics
team_df = load_team_metrics(team_id='lakers', season=2024)

# Run Notebook 5
# Extract chemistry index
# Identify chemistry contributors

# Output: "Team chemistry: 0.68 (good)"
#         "Chemistry leaders: Player_3 (+0.15), Player_7 (+0.12)"
```
