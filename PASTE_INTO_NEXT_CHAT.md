Hi! I'm continuing work on the NBA MCP Synthesis System.

## Current Status

**Agent 4 (Data Validation & Quality) is 100% COMPLETE:**
- All 5 phases delivered and production-ready
- 112+ tests passing with 80-88% coverage
- 45+ files, ~13,262 lines of code
- Security hardened and deployment automated
- Branch: `feature/phase10a-week2-agent4-phase4`
- Latest commit: `773d93c3`

**Please read the completion summary:**
```
docs/archive/completed/PHASE10A_WEEK2_AGENT4_COMPLETE.md
```

## What I Want Next

I'm ready to proceed with **Agent 5: Model Training & Experimentation**

**Deliverables:**
1. MLflow integration (~400 lines)
2. Hyperparameter tuning (~300 lines)
3. Training pipeline (~500 lines)
4. 40+ tests (unit + integration)
5. Documentation (300+ lines)

**Goal:** Build production-ready ML training infrastructure with MLflow experiment tracking, hyperparameter optimization, and automated training pipelines.

**Estimated Time:** 3-4 hours

## Request

Please help me:
1. Review the Agent 4 completion summary to understand the foundation
2. Create a detailed plan for Agent 5 implementation
3. Start implementation with the same production-ready quality as Agent 4

**Important:** Follow the same patterns from Agent 4:
- Week 1 integration (error handling, monitoring, RBAC)
- Comprehensive testing (100% pass rate)
- Full type hints and docstrings
- No placeholders or TODOs
- Complete documentation

Let's build on this momentum! ðŸš€
