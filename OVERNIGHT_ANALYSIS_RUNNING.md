## 💰 Cost Tracking

The analysis tracks costs in real-time:
- Gemini 1.5 Pro: Tiered pricing (<128k cheaper)
- Claude Sonnet 4: $3/M input, $15/M output
- Cache hits: **$0** (100% savings!)

**Example from log:**
```
💰 Analysis cost: $1.1546
   Gemini 1.5 Pro: $0.4440
   Claude Sonnet 4: $0.7106
📊 Content analyzed: 660,072 characters
💾 Cache HIT!
```

## 🔄 Progress Indicators

### What's Running
- ✅ Secrets loaded (34 secrets)
- ✅ Gemini 1.5 Pro initialized
- ✅ Claude Sonnet 4 initialized
- ✅ S3 connection established
- ✅ Cache system active
- 🔄 Iterative convergence enhancement
- 🔄 Multi-model consensus synthesis

### Convergence Tracking
Each book goes through up to 200 iterations until:
- 3 consecutive iterations find only "Nice-to-Have" recommendations
- OR maximum iterations reached

## 📋 Expected Deliverables

### After Completion (~5-10 PM tonight)

1. **Analysis Results** - Individual analysis for each book
2. **Convergence Reports** - Tracker files showing iteration progress
3. **Master Recommendations** - Consolidated recommendations JSON
4. **Implementation Plans** - Generated code and integration guides
5. **Cost Report** - Complete breakdown of API costs
6. **Convergence Comparison** - `CONVERGENCE_ENHANCEMENT_RESULTS.md`

### Summary Files
- `analysis_results/post_convergence_summary.json`
- `CONVERGENCE_ENHANCEMENT_RESULTS.md`
- `cost_tracker/cost_summary.json`

## ⚠️ Monitoring & Control

### Check Status
```bash
# Is it still running?
ps aux | grep 46664

# Recent activity
tail -50 logs/overnight_convergence_20251023_071235.log

# How many books completed?
ls -1 analysis_results/*_RECOMMENDATIONS_COMPLETE.md | wc -l
```

### Emergency Stop (if needed)
```bash
# Stop the analysis
kill 46664

# Or force stop
kill -9 46664

# Check it stopped
ps aux | grep 46664
```

### Resume (if stopped)
```bash
# The analysis will automatically resume from last checkpoint
# Just run the same command again
python3 scripts/run_overnight_with_secrets.py
```

---

## 🎯 Next Steps (After Completion)

1. **Review Results**
   ```bash
   cat CONVERGENCE_ENHANCEMENT_RESULTS.md
   ```

2. **Check Costs**
   ```bash
   cat cost_tracker/cost_summary.json
   ```

3. **Examine Recommendations**
   ```bash
   cat analysis_results/master_recommendations.json | jq '.recommendations | length'
   ```

4. **Deploy to nba-simulator-aws** (Phase 10B-12B)
