## Known Issues & Follow-Up Items

### Session 1 Integration Tests

**Issue:** Integration tests have import errors due to API mismatches

**Details:**
- Tests import `ModelTrainingPipeline` instead of `TrainingPipeline`
- Tests reference `TrainingConfig` which doesn't exist
- Tests created without full knowledge of actual APIs

**Impact:** Low - core functionality validated by Agent 4-6 test suites

**Recommendation:**
- Review actual API exports for each module
- Update integration test imports to match
- Adjust test logic to use correct APIs
- Estimated effort: 2-4 hours

### Test Suite Optimization

**Observation:** Full test suite takes >3 minutes to run

**Recommendation:**
- Profile slow tests
- Implement test parallelization (pytest-xdist)
- Use test markers for selective runs
- Cache test fixtures
