## Overview
Phase 7.1: Intelligent Formula Recommendations has been successfully implemented as part of the NBA MCP Server's Advanced Intelligence & Automation features. This phase introduces AI-powered formula suggestions based on user context, preferences, and analysis requirements.

## Implementation Summary

### Core Components Implemented

#### 1. Parameter Models (`mcp_server/tools/params.py`)
- **IntelligentRecommendationParams**: General formula recommendations based on context, user preferences, current formulas, analysis type, max recommendations, explanations, and confidence threshold
- **FormulaSuggestionParams**: Formula suggestions based on data description, available variables, target metric, complexity, interaction terms, and max suggestions
- **ContextAnalysisParams**: User context analysis including query, session history, current analysis, expertise level, preferred formula types, and analysis depth
- **PredictiveAnalysisParams**: Predictive analytics recommendations based on prediction target, historical data, prediction horizon, confidence level, uncertainty, and model complexity
- **ErrorCorrectionParams**: Error detection and correction based on formula expression, expected result, input values, error tolerance, and validation level

#### 2. Core Logic Module (`mcp_server/tools/intelligent_recommendations.py`)
- **IntelligentRecommendationEngine**: Main class for intelligent formula recommendations

### Technical Implementation

#### 1. Formula Loading and Categorization
```python
def _load_formula_database(self) -> Dict[str, Dict[str, Any]]:
    """Load formulas from algebra helper"""
    # Loads 30+ sports analytics formulas
    # Categorizes by type (efficiency, shooting, defensive, etc.)
    # Assesses complexity levels
    # Identifies use cases
```

#### 2. Context Analysis
```python
def _analyze_context(self, context: RecommendationContext) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Analyze the recommendation context"""
    # Extracts keywords from user queries
    # Determines analysis type and preferences
    # Assesses user expertise level
    # Identifies preferred categories
```

#### 3. Recommendation Generation
```python
def get_intelligent_recommendations(self, context: RecommendationContext,
                                  max_recommendations: int = 5,
                                  confidence_threshold: float = 0.7) -> List[FormulaRecommendation]:
    """Get intelligent formula recommendations based on context"""
    # Combines multiple recommendation strategies
    # Filters by confidence threshold
    # Ranks by relevance and confidence
    # Returns top recommendations
```
