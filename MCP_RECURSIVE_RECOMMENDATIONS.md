### 🆕 **NEW RECOMMENDATIONS (Iteration 1)**

#### **🔴 CRITICAL (Add to Implementation Plans)**

##### **11. Add Stream Processing Support**
**Book Reference:** Chapter 3, pages 75-85

**Why It Matters:**
> "Modern ML systems need both batch and stream processing. Batch for training, streaming for real-time features and predictions."

**Current State:**
- Only batch processing via scheduled jobs
- No real-time feature updates
- No streaming predictions

**Implementation:**
```python
# New files needed:
stream_processing/
├── kafka_connector.py       # Connect to Kafka
├── stream_processor.py      # Process streams
├── feature_updater.py       # Update features in real-time
└── stream_predictor.py      # Real-time predictions
```

**Priority:** HIGH
**Time:** 2 weeks
**Impact:** Enable real-time ML

---

##### **12. Implement Data Lineage Tracking**
**Book Reference:** Chapter 3, pages 88-92

**Why It Matters:**
> "Without data lineage, you can't debug model issues, can't ensure compliance, and can't reproduce results."

**Current State:**
- No tracking from raw data → features → models
- Can't trace prediction back to source data
- Compliance risk

**Implementation:**
```python
# Add to existing:
data_quality/
└── lineage_tracker.py       # Track data lineage

# Track:
# - Raw data sources
# - Transformations applied
# - Features generated
# - Models trained
# - Predictions made
```

**Priority:** HIGH
**Time:** 1 week
**Impact:** Debugging, compliance, reproducibility

---

##### **13. Define Service Level Objectives (SLOs)**
**Book Reference:** Chapter 2, pages 45-50

**Why It Matters:**
> "SLOs define what 'working' means. Without them, you can't measure success or detect failures early."

**Current State:**
- No latency targets
- No availability requirements
- No accuracy thresholds

**Implementation:**
```yaml
# slos.yaml
prediction_service:
  latency_p95: 100ms
  latency_p99: 200ms
  availability: 99.9%
  accuracy_threshold: 0.90

training_pipeline:
  completion_time: 6h
  success_rate: 95%

data_pipeline:
  freshness: 1h
  completeness: 99%
```

**Priority:** HIGH
**Time:** 2 days
**Impact:** Clear success metrics

---

#### **🟡 IMPORTANT (Medium Priority)**

##### **14. Add Circuit Breakers**
**Book Reference:** Chapter 2, pages 52-55

**Why It Matters:**
> "When dependencies fail, circuit breakers prevent cascading failures."

**Implementation:**
```python
from circuitbreaker import circuit

@circuit(failure_threshold=5, recovery_timeout=60)
def query_rds():
    # If RDS fails 5 times, circuit opens
    # Calls fail fast for 60s
    # Then retry
    pass
```

**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Time:** 3 days

---

##### **15. Implement Request Queueing**
**Book Reference:** Chapter 1, pages 25-28

**Why It Matters:**
> "Queues smooth traffic spikes and enable asynchronous processing."

**Implementation:**
```python
# Use Celery + Redis
@app.task
def predict_async(player_stats):
    return model.predict(player_stats)

# Client:
task = predict_async.delay(stats)
result = task.get(timeout=10)
```

**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Time:** 1 week

---

##### **16. Add Data Versioning (DVC)**
**Book Reference:** Chapter 3, pages 80-83

**Why It Matters:**
> "Version data like code. Essential for reproducibility."

**Implementation:**
```bash
pip install dvc[s3]
dvc init
dvc remote add -d storage s3://nba-mcp-books-20251011/dvc-storage
dvc add data/
git add data.dvc .dvc/config
git commit -m "Track data with DVC"
```

**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Time:** 2 days

---

##### **17. Expand Data Quality Monitoring**
**Book Reference:** Chapter 3, pages 85-88

**Current:** Great Expectations present but underutilized

**Expand to:**
- Automated daily data quality checks
- Alert on quality drops
- Track quality trends
- Integrate with monitoring dashboards

**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Time:** 1 week

---

##### **18. Add Load Testing**
**Book Reference:** Chapter 2, pages 58-60

**Implementation:**
```python
# Use Locust for load testing
from locust import HttpUser, task, between

class MCPUser(HttpUser):
    wait_time = between(1, 3)

    @task
    def predict(self):
        self.client.post("/predict", json={"stats": [...]})
```

**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Time:** 3 days

---

#### **🟢 NICE-TO-HAVE (Low Priority)**

##### **19. Add API Gateway**
**Book Reference:** Chapter 2, pages 48-50

**Benefits:**
- Rate limiting
- Authentication
- Request routing
- API versioning

**Priority:** LOW
**Time:** 1 week

---

##### **20. Implement Caching Strategy**
**Book Reference:** Chapter 1, pages 22-25

**Already Identified,** but book provides more details:
- Cache at multiple levels
- Use Redis for hot data
- Implement cache invalidation
- Monitor cache hit rates

**Priority:** LOW
**Time:** 3 days
