## Key Decisions & Trade-offs

### What We're Implementing
✅ Critical statistical methods (time series, panel data, Bayesian)
✅ Performance optimization and scalability
✅ Core simulator improvements
✅ Comprehensive testing infrastructure
✅ Production deployment

### What We're Deferring
❌ All 1,630 "nice-to-have" recommendations
❌ Advanced exotic ML techniques (GANs, transformers for this use case)
❌ Multi-region deployment (can be added later)
❌ Real-time streaming (Kafka) - can be phase 2
❌ AutoML capabilities - can be phase 2

### Rationale
This focused approach gives us:
1. Complete, production-ready system
2. All critical functionality
3. High-quality, well-tested code
4. Reasonable timeline (4-7 months vs 12-18 months for all recs)
5. Room for future enhancements post-deployment

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Complexity:** Advanced statistical methods may be complex
  - *Mitigation:* Start simple, iterate, leverage existing libraries

- **Integration:** New modules must integrate cleanly
  - *Mitigation:* Follow established patterns from Agents 4-7

- **Performance:** New features may impact performance
  - *Mitigation:* Profile continuously, optimize early

### Timeline Risks
- **Scope Creep:** Tendency to add more features
  - *Mitigation:* Strict focus on critical items only

- **Testing Time:** Comprehensive testing takes time
  - *Mitigation:* Write tests alongside code, not after

## Progress Tracking

We'll create weekly summaries tracking:
- Modules completed
- Tests written/passing
- Documentation progress
- Issues/blockers
- Timeline vs plan

**Weekly Report Template:**
```markdown
# Week [N] Progress Report
- Modules: [X/Y] complete
- Tests: [X] written, [X] passing ([%] pass rate)
- Lines: [X] code, [X] tests
- Blockers: [list]
- Next week: [plan]
```
