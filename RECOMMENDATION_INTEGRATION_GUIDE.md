# Recommendation Integration System - Usage Guide

This guide explains how to use the Recommendation Organization & Integration System to automatically organize book recommendations and integrate them into the NBA Simulator AWS project.

## Overview

The Recommendation Integration System consists of several components that work together to:

1. **Load recommendations** from the master recommendations database
2. **Map recommendations** to relevant NBA Simulator AWS project phases (0-9)
3. **Generate phase-specific enhancement documents** with organized recommendations
4. **Analyze conflicts** between new recommendations and existing plans
5. **Apply safe updates** automatically while flagging conflicts for manual review
6. **Track implementation status** across both projects
7. **Generate comprehensive reports** of the integration process

## System Components

### Core Classes

- **`PhaseMapper`**: Maps recommendations to NBA Simulator AWS phases based on keywords
- **`RecommendationIntegrator`**: Loads recommendations and generates phase enhancement documents
- **`PlanOverrideManager`**: Analyzes conflicts and applies safe updates to existing plans
- **`CrossProjectTracker`**: Scans both projects and tracks implementation status

### Main Script

- **`integrate_recommendations.py`**: Orchestrates the entire integration workflow

## Usage

### Basic Integration

To run the integration system with existing recommendations:

```bash
cd /Users/ryanranft/nba-mcp-synthesis
python3 scripts/integrate_recommendations.py
```

### What Happens During Integration

1. **Load Recommendations**: Reads from `analysis_results/master_recommendations.json`
2. **Map to Phases**: Uses keyword matching to assign recommendations to phases
3. **Generate Documents**: Creates `RECOMMENDATIONS_FROM_BOOKS.md` files in each relevant phase directory
4. **Analyze Conflicts**: Checks for conflicts with existing phase plans
5. **Apply Updates**: Automatically applies safe updates to `PHASE_X_INDEX.md` files
6. **Generate Reports**: Creates integration summary and cross-project status reports

### Output Files

The integration system generates several files:

#### Phase Enhancement Documents
- **Location**: `/Users/ryanranft/nba-simulator-aws/docs/phases/phase_X/RECOMMENDATIONS_FROM_BOOKS.md`
- **Content**: Organized recommendations by priority (Critical, Important, Nice-to-Have)
- **Purpose**: Phase-specific guidance for implementation

#### Integration Reports
- **`integration_summary.md`**: Comprehensive summary of the integration process
- **`CROSS_PROJECT_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md`**: Status tracking across both projects

#### Plan Updates
- **`PHASE_X_INDEX.md`**: Updated with new recommendations (if no conflicts)
- **`PROPOSED_UPDATES.md`**: Generated when conflicts require manual review

## Phase Mapping

The system maps recommendations to NBA Simulator AWS phases based on keywords:

| Phase | Focus | Keywords |
|-------|-------|----------|
| 0 | Data Collection | data collection, scraping, ingestion, sources |
| 1 | Data Quality & Integration | data quality, validation, integration, deduplication |
| 2 | AWS Glue ETL | etl, glue, transformation, pipeline |
| 3 | Database Infrastructure | database, postgresql, rds, schema |
| 4 | Simulation Engine | simulation, temporal, panel data, fidelity |
| 5 | Machine Learning Models | machine learning, ml models, training, prediction |
| 6 | Optional Enhancements | enhancements, optimization, performance |
| 7 | Betting Odds Integration | betting, odds, gambling, lines |
| 8 | Recursive Data Discovery | discovery, analysis, insights |
| 9 | System Architecture | architecture, infrastructure, deployment |

## Conflict Detection

The system automatically detects conflicts between new recommendations and existing plans:

- **Enhancements**: Recommendations that improve existing plans (applied automatically)
- **New Additions**: Recommendations that add new capabilities (applied automatically)
- **Conflicts**: Recommendations that contradict existing approaches (require manual review)

## Example Integration Results

### Successful Integration
```
✅ Integration complete!
   📊 Total recommendations processed: 10
   📁 Phase docs generated: 4
   ✅ Safe updates applied: 12
   ⚠️  Conflicts pending review: 0
   📈 Cross-project status: Updated
```

### With Conflicts
```
⚠️  Next Steps:
   1. Review 3 conflicts requiring manual attention
   2. Check PROPOSED_UPDATES.md files in phase directories
   3. Resolve conflicts and update plans as needed
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Slow Scanning**: The cross-project tracker may take time to scan large projects
   - **Solution**: The system is optimized with depth limits and exclusions
   - **Note**: Scanning is limited to 2 levels deep for performance

2. **Missing Recommendations**: No recommendations found in master database
   - **Solution**: Ensure `analysis_results/master_recommendations.json` exists and contains recommendations
   - **Fallback**: The system can create sample data for testing

3. **Path Errors**: Incorrect project paths
   - **Solution**: Verify paths in `integrate_recommendations.py`:
     ```python
     synthesis_path = "/Users/ryanranft/nba-mcp-synthesis"
     simulator_path = "/Users/ryanranft/nba-simulator-aws"
     ```

### Performance Optimization

The system includes several performance optimizations:

- **File Scanning**: Limited to 2 levels deep, excludes large directories
- **Module Discovery**: Limited to 3 levels deep, excludes common non-module directories
- **Timeout Protection**: Commands have timeouts to prevent hanging
- **Result Caching**: Cross-project status is cached to avoid repeated scans

## Integration with Book Analysis Workflow

This system is designed to work with the Recursive Book Analysis Workflow:

1. **Book Analysis**: Generates recommendations from technical books
2. **Master Database**: Stores all recommendations in `master_recommendations.json`
3. **Integration**: This system organizes and integrates recommendations
4. **Implementation**: Phase-specific documents guide implementation

## Testing

The system includes comprehensive tests:

```bash
cd /Users/ryanranft/nba-mcp-synthesis
python3 -m pytest tests/test_recommendation_integration.py -v
```

Tests cover:
- Phase mapping accuracy
- Recommendation integration
- Conflict detection
- Cross-project tracking
- Error handling

## Customization

### Adding New Phase Keywords

To improve phase mapping, edit `scripts/phase_mapper.py`:

```python
self.phase_keywords = {
    0: ["data collection", "scraping", "ingestion", "sources", "your_new_keyword"],
    # ... other phases
}
```

### Modifying Conflict Detection

To enhance conflict detection, edit `scripts/plan_override_manager.py`:

```python
def _conflicts_with_plan(self, rec: Dict, existing_plan_content: str) -> bool:
    # Add your custom conflict detection logic here
    pass
```

### Customizing Output Format

To modify the output format, edit the formatting methods in:
- `scripts/recommendation_integrator.py` (phase documents)
- `scripts/integrate_recommendations.py` (summary reports)

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Integration**: Run integration after adding new book recommendations
2. **Review Conflicts**: Always review conflicts flagged for manual attention
3. **Update Plans**: Keep phase plans updated with integrated recommendations
4. **Monitor Status**: Use cross-project status reports to track progress
5. **Test Changes**: Run tests after modifying the system

## Support

For issues or questions:

1. Check the integration summary for error details
2. Review the cross-project status report
3. Run tests to verify system functionality
4. Check logs for detailed error information
